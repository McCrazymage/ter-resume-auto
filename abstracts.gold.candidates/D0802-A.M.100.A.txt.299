The eight-nation Arctic Council said the annual average amount of sea ice around the North Pole has decreased about 8 percent in 30 years because of global warming fueled by greenhouse gas emissions. He urged European nations to lower emissions beyond what's required under the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. ``To some, that's just the difference between putting a jacket on and off,'' said Clive Tesar, of the council's Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat. The softening permafrost has already driven some polar animals further north.
