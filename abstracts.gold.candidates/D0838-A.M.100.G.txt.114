The most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory. The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands-free device in the car and how often the device was used. Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
