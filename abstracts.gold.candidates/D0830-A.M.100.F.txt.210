Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match.
