Those in the control room are employees of a quasi-governmental entity called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. It's ready to meet the demands of 20 million Texans; ready to deal with another peak day like that of Aug. 7, 2003, when the state's electrical usage reached a record 60,095 megawatts.
