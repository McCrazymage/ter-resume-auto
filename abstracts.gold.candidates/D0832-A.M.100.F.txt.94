When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother to put it on the market. Government contracts for the company, whose Web site describes it as helping solve ``enigmatic problems ... in the areas of intelligence collection and analysis,'' grew from $41 million in 2003 to $66 million in 2004, according to Washington Technology magazine. MZM, one of Cunningham's top campaign donors, obtained millions in government contracts; the congressman, who also sits on the House intelligence committee, acknowledged to Stern that he had helped MZM win contracts, as he said he has helped other firms.
