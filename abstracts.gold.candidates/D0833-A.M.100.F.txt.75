India plans to put a 525 kg orbiter using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket 100 km over the moon to explore the earth's satellite. India's mission is aimed at expanding the scientific knowledge about the moon, upgrading India's technological capability and providing challenging opportunities for planetary research to the younger generation. ISRO had allotted 10 kgs and 10 watts of power for space agencies of other nations and had invited international bids for the purpose that had evoked 15 responses from 10 nations.
