Gunmen stormed into the city's Chaldean and Armenian churches in the latest attacks on Iraq's minority Christian community, they said. ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church.
