Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations.

Fannie Mae, which for years has been one of the most formidable political forces in Washington, maintained a low public profile.
