``The fact that the book has already hit No. 1 in our Hot 100 books chart shows how incredibly excited customers are about the sixth Harry Potter,'' amazon.co.uk managing director Robin Terrell said. Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item. Jo Marino, a spokeswoman for Waterstones bookstore chain, said customers had started calling its stores to place orders for the book immediately after publishers announced the release date Tuesday.
