Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the preserve's director. The stage begins when the bamboo forms flowers, after which the pandas refuse to eat it. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
