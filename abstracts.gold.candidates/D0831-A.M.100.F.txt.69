Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three Americans. Augusto Castro, vice president of the Catholic Church's ruling body in Colombia, said he hopes the FARC reacts positively to the offer. ``This proposal addresses the need to find a solution at a time when we are all concerned about being on a street with no exits,'' said Castro.
