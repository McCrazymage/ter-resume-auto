In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin, Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast.
