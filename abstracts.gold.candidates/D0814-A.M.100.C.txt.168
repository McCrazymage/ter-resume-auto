Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said. The prime minister denied that any of the European countries has desire to send troops to Darfur, stressing the capability of the African forces to control the situation in Darfur. Blair described his talks with Sudanese officials as constructive, urging the conflicting sides in Darfur to fulfill their commitments within a week or a month.
