The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Church.
