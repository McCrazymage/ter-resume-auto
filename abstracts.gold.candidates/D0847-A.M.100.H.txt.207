Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary election dominated by pro-presidential forces simmered for a second week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene. The police were not reported to have used excessive force. Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the government and the presidency.
