Hurricane Katrina could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars (40 billion euros), British company Brit Insurance forecast on Tuesday. Katrina will have ``a profound impact on (insurance) market conditions'', Douetil added. Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters. Qatar ``is following up with profound sorrow'' the tragic results of the Katrina Hurricane, the source added.
