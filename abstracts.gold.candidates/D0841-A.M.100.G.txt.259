But according to an opinion poll conducted in late July, some two-thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and now the cabinet has approved the bill such liaisons could become legal from as early as next year. The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual. Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt.
