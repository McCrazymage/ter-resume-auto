Nevertheless, this new generation of anti-evolutionists, arguing that children have a ``right to question'' scientific truths, has had widespread success in undermining evolutionary theory. In states as diverse as Wisconsin, South Carolina, Kansas, Montana, Arkansas and Mississippi, school boards are arguing over whether to include ``intelligent design'' in their curriculums. Rather than attempt to prove that the world was created in six days, they operate simply by casting doubt on evolution, largely using the time-honored argument that intelligent life could not have come about by a random natural process and must have been the work of a single creator.
