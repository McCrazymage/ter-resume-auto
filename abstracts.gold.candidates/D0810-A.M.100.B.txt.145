On Capitol Hill, lawmakers vowed to swiftly overhaul the oversight of the federally chartered company. The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Raines after the announcement by the SEC's top accountant that the company had violated two rules. Fannie Mae, which for years has been one of the most formidable political forces in Washington, maintained a low public profile. The company declined to comment further about the findings of the SEC staff or the remarks of lawmakers.
