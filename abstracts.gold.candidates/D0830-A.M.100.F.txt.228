Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
