The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. The black-and- white bird, with a nearly one-meter wingspan and its distinctive ivory-colored bill, is larger than the more common pileated woodpecker that is similar in appearance. ``This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation,'' he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
