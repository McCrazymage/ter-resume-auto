``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
