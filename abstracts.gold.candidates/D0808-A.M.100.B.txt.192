Two churches in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul came under simultaneous attack on Tuesday, witnesses and clerics said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. At the same moment, gunmen attacked an Armenian church, forcing out a security guard and two other people inside the building, the guard said, adding : ``I heard two explosions.'' The Chaldeans, whose 600,000 people represent the majority of Christians in Iraq, are an oriental rite Catholic community. Iraq's Christian parties complain they lack funding and are living in danger ahead of landmark parliamentary elections scheduled for January 30.
