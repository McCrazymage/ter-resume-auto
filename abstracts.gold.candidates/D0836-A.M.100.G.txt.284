Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying-off stage. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of the 220,000-hectare (544,000-acre) preserve, Xinhua said. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation.
