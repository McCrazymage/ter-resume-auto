Republican Dino Rossi held a mere 261-vote lead over Democratic Attorney General Christine Gregoire after all counties reported their final tallies to the state. ``After this election, I'm going to have' Every vote counts' tattooed on my forehead,'' Gregoire spokesman Morton Brilliant said Wednesday. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has ``never seen anything like this before.'' The election is reminiscent of the 2000 U.S. Senate race in Washington that took several weeks of counting and recounting before Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner over Republican incumbent Slade Gorton.
