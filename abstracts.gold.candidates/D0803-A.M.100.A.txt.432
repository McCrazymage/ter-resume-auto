In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide. Violation of safety rules was attributed to Sunday's deadly colliery gas blast that killed 16 persons in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, investigators said here Tuesday. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
