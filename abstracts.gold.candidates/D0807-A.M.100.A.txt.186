In no case other than Libby's does the indictment contend that one of the government employees provided the name to reporters. Cheney told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, information that Libby understood came from the agency, the indictment said.

This person, identified as ``Official A,'' also spoke about Plame's job and identity with columnist Robert Novak a few days before Novak's column appeared.
