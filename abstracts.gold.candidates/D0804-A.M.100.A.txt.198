But when rescue workers airlifted the owner last week, Molly, a black Labrador seeing-eye dog, was left behind. An animal-control officer in waders stepped into water that still rose halfway up the first floor, and she climbed the stairs. Five days passed, said Laura Maloney, director of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before the New Orleans police, National Guard soldiers and a man named Joe with a boat found their way to the house. Within 24 hours dog and owner were reunited in Lake Charles, La.
