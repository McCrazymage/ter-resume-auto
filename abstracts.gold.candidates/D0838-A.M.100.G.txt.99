The most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory. It is also the first to definitively conclude outside of a laboratory setting that holding a phone to your ear and talking through a hands-free device poses the same risks. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone.
