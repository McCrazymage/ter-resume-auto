Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three Americans. The proposal calls for a total of 50 jailed rebels to be freed in return for about 60 so-called political prisoners the FARC is holding in jungle hideouts.
