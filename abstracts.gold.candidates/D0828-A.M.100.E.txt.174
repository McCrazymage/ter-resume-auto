( c) 2004, Newsday= NEW YORK -- Martha Stewart says she has been deluged by ``thousands'' of letters from fans sent to her federal prison camp in Alderson, W.V., some of which have even included gifts and money. In a posting on her Web site, marthatalks.com, Stewart instead urged fans to make a donation to the American Cancer Society instead. Dawn Zobel, a public information officer at Alderson, said she could neither confirm nor deny that Stewart has been the recipient of such a tsunami of mail.
