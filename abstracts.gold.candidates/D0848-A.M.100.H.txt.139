The European Union (EU) sent a clear warning to Turkey on Thursday over the trial of a well-known novelist, saying it would affect the Muslim country's EU accession process. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this. The charges stem from his remarks in an interview with a Swiss newspaper in which he said ``30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in Turkey'' during World War I and in the 1980s and 1990s.
