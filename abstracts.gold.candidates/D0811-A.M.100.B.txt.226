The planet is a typical member of the Kuiper belt, but its sheer size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be classified as a planet, Brown said. ``It's definitely bigger than Pluto,'' he said of the body made up of ice and rock. Because it was moving, astronomers ruled it was a moon and not a background star, which is stationary. While observing the new, so-called planet from Hawaii last month, a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it.
