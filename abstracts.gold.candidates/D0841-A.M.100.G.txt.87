The plan ``recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner,'' cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. ``It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life,'' insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference. The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans.
