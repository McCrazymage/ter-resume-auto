Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying-off stage. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. However, the cycle seems to run along different schedules in different places and an earlier mass die-off of bamboo in the 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 pandas, Xinhua said. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
