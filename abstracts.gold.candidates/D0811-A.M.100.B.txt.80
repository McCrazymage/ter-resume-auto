The body is ``the 10th planet of the solar system,'' said Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech in the town of Pasadena. The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet's mass. While observing the new, so-called planet from Hawaii last month, a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it.
