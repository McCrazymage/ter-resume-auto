Some 300 supporters of a candidate who lost his bid for a parliament seat to the daughter of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev gathered in central Bishkek, in the words of one, to ``hold a peaceful meeting to defend freedom of speech and honest elections.'' The police were not reported to have used excessive force.
