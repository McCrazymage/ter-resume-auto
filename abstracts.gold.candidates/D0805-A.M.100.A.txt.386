Medicare has a toll-free hotline and a Web site to help people sort through the new Part D drug coverage. If you want Medicare to help you compare drug plans, here are a few suggestions. 1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your medications handy. 3) After listing some pertinent dates, you will be asked to select either ``enrollment'' ``information'' or ``publication.'' 4) If you pick the ``information'' option, you may find yourself in a loop of various recordings.
