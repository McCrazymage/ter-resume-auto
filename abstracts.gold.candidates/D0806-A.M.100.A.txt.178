The agreement, which involves emergency weekend sessions of both the House and Senate, marks the first time Congress has intervened directly in an individual right-to-die case. Outside the nursing facility in Florida where Schiavo is being cared for, her mother had pleaded earlier Saturday for lawmakers and the president to intervene. A vigil was kept at the facility in Pinellas Park; three people were arrested when they tried to enter the hospice. ``Please, please, please save my little girl,'' said Mary Schindler.
