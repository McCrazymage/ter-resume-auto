Some 300 supporters of a candidate who lost his bid for a parliament seat to the daughter of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev gathered in central Bishkek, in the words of one, to ``hold a peaceful meeting to defend freedom of speech and honest elections.'' Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. The parliamentary elections, which are a stepping stone to presidential elections on October 30, have been surrounded by controversy, with protests in several parts of this mountainous country in the days leading up to the vote.
