Gunmen stormed into the city's Chaldean and Armenian churches in the latest attacks on Iraq's minority Christian community, they said. ``We were then taken outside and the armed men set off the devices. We heard three blasts,'' he told AFP outside the church which was set ablaze. On November 8, at least three people were killed and 45 wounded when two suspected car bombs exploded within minutes of each other outside two churches in southern Baghdad. In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
