Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item. The company was expecting a similar response for the latest installment. The latest installment in the Harry Potter series won't hit stores for more than six months but it has already topped at least one bookseller's most wanted list and is racking up thousands of advance orders, retailers said Wednesday. ``There is so much demand people want to make sure they get their copy,'' Marino said.
