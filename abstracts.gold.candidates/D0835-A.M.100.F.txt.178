Some have even suggested that people in the commissioner's office have been winking at one another while they make public pronouncements against steroid use. From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. The prevailing view was that top offensive performances in baseball demanded quick reflexes, good eye-hand coordination, quick feet, flexibility and strong wrists -- not bulky muscles. They would benefit from taking a step back and looking more carefully at the evolution of the steroid problem in baseball.
