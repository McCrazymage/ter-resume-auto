Hurricane Katrina could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars (40 billion euros), British company Brit Insurance forecast on Tuesday. Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars. The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani decided on Saturday to contribute 100 million US dollars to the victims of the Katrina hurricane in the United States. Qatar ``is following up with profound sorrow'' the tragic results of the Katrina Hurricane, the source added.
