Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. The accident happened at Taiping Coal Mine of Qingxu County, when 25 persons were working underground.
