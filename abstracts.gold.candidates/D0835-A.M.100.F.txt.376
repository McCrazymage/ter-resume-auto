Some have even suggested that people in the commissioner's office have been winking at one another while they make public pronouncements against steroid use. From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. Before the mid-1990s, the substances of choice in the clubhouse were amphetamines and recreational drugs. But as baseball became more aware of this as a growing issue, the commissioner's office did, in fact, act. Indeed, it was probably around 10 years ago that some people in baseball became aware that anabolic steroids were being used by some players.
