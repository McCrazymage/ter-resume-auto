Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity. Russian navy officials said the mini-submarine, trapped at a depth of 190 meters (625 feet), had seven sailors aboard, and it was unclear how long their oxygen supply would last. Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the U.S. Navy has also been asked for assistance, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported. Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help.
