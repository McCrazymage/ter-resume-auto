In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin, Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The workers also gaze at something more familiar : two monitors displaying The Weather Channel. Studies of the outages indicated problems in Canada cascaded into the Northeast, leaving New York and Detroit without power for days. Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the state because the system isn't connected to other major grids in North America.
