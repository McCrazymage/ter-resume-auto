In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. Violation of safety rules was attributed to Sunday's deadly colliery gas blast that killed 16 persons in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, investigators said here Tuesday. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production. The accident happened at Taiping Coal Mine of Qingxu County, when 25 persons were working underground.
