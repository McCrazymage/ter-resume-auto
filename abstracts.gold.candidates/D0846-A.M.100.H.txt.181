``We estimate there are almost 800,000 faithful at the moment, but people continue to fill up the Blonia esplanadae,'' said police spokeswoman Sylwia Bober. Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to ``be himself.'' The next pope should not try to be another John Paul II, the Polish-born pope's first private secretary, Irish Bishop John Magee, said Thursday. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
