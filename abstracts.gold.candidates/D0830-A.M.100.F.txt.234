Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
