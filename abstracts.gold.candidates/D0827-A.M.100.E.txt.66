``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani decided on Saturday to contribute 100 million US dollars to the victims of the Katrina hurricane in the United States. Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters.
