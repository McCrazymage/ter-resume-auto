Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
