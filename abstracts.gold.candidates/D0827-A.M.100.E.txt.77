``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. The Qatar News Agency quoted a source at the Foreign Ministry as saying that the donation was made in the name of the government and people of Qatar. Qatar ``is following up with profound sorrow'' the tragic results of the Katrina Hurricane, the source added.
