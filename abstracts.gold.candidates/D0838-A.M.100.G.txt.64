A study of Australian drivers found that those using cell phones were four times as likely to be involved in a serious crash regardless of whether they used hands-free devices like earpieces or speaker phones that have been perceived as making talking while driving safer. Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands-free device in the car and how often the device was used.
