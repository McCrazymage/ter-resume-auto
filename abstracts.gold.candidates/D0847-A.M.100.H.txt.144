Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev insisted that voting in crucial parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic on Sunday was being conducted fairly, but a leading opposition figure cried foul. Opposition supporters in Kyrgyzstan have held protests for more than a week since a March 13 run-off election that saw the opposition presence in the 75-member parliament reduced to a mere handful of seats. The parliamentary elections, which are a stepping stone to presidential elections on October 30, have been surrounded by controversy, with protests in several parts of this mountainous country in the days leading up to the vote.
