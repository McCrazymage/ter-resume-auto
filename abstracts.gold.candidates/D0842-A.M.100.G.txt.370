Inhabitants of Akhaltsikhe blocked a dozen trucks carrying pipes belonging the oil company British Petroleum (BP). Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline. In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year. The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey.
