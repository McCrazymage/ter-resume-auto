If you want Medicare to help you compare drug plans, here are a few suggestions. 1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your medications handy. The fastest way to talk to a live person is to select ``enrollment.'' 3) After listing some pertinent dates, you will be asked to select either ``enrollment'' ``information'' or ``publication.'' 4) If you pick the ``information'' option, you may find yourself in a loop of various recordings. 5) Tell the agent you want a list of stand-alone drug plans and their costs to you, based on your particular medications.
