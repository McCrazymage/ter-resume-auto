Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
