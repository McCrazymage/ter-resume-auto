Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the preserve's director. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. Giant pandas in western China could be at risk of starvation because the bamboo plants that they eat are beginning to die off in a cycle that happens about every 60 years, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation.
