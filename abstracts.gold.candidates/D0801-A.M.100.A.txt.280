French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the ``total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380.'' After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. In a statement released by his office soon after the airliner landed, Chirac said ``a new page of aeronautical history has been written.It is a magnificent result for European industrial cooperation and an encouragement to pursue this path of building a Europe of innovation and progress.'' ``The takeoff went perfectly,'' Alain Garcia, an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in Paris.
