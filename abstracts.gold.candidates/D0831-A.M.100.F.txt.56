Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three Americans. ``All we 're looking for is a minimum sign of hope and we will start the ball rolling,'' Restrepo told local radio. The previous administration of President Andres Pastrana held face-to-face peace talks with the FARC for three years inside a safe haven as large as Switzerland in the jungles and cattle country of southern Colombia.
