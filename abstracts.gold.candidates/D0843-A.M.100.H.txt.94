Less than 24 hours after publishers announced a July 16 release date for ``Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince'' _British author J.K. Rowling's sixth novel set in the halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry_ it had shot to No. 1 on online bookseller amazon.co.uk's Hot 100 book list. The company was expecting a similar response for the latest installment. Jo Marino, a spokeswoman for Waterstones bookstore chain, said customers had started calling its stores to place orders for the book immediately after publishers announced the release date Tuesday.
