After any initial prisoner exchange, the meeting, which could last up to five days, would take place in the Vatican's embassy in Bogota or at another diplomatic mission in the capital, according to the government proposal, which was first announced Thursday night and then amplified Friday. The proposal calls for a total of 50 jailed rebels to be freed in return for about 60 so-called political prisoners the FARC is holding in jungle hideouts. Augusto Castro, vice president of the Catholic Church's ruling body in Colombia, said he hopes the FARC reacts positively to the offer.
