The bus explosion was one of four co-ordinated bombings, the others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in the morning rush hour. ``I think we are going to see photographs of one or more suspects being posted within days,'' the official told the paper. ``There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top of it,'' a ``senior police source'' told the paper.
