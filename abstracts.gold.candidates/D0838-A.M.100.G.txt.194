Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands-free device in the car and how often the device was used. Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
