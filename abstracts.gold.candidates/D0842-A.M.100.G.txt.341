BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline. The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
