North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. North Korea declared on February 10 it possessed nuclear weapons and said it needed them as a deterrent to what it said were US plans to launch a nuclear attack against it. Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13-day session in Beijing. That they lasted so long is encouraging : Three previous rounds ended after only three days.
