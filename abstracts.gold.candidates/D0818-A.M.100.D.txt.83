Evelyn Hutcheson and David Hale, the mother and brother of Matthew Hale, the man convicted last year of plotting the murder of the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow, said Wednesday that federal agents had asked them whether Hale might have communicated something from prison in code. David Hale' told the authorities that he came home from his maintenance job at 1:30 p.m. Monday, took a nap, ate dinner and watched a movie with his children, then went to a local convenience store that has a security camera. ``They know where I was and I 've been cleared,'' David Hale said Wednesday.
