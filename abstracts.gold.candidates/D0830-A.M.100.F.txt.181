Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. ``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
