In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. Official statistics said that from January to September this year, 4,228 people were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. Violation of safety rules was attributed to Sunday's deadly colliery gas blast that killed 16 persons in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, investigators said here Tuesday. The accident happened at Taiping Coal Mine of Qingxu County, when 25 persons were working underground.
