The submarine tender, which is equipped with rescue gear, left from Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo and is expected to rendezvous with the other ships at the site off Russia's Pacific coast on Monday or Tuesday, he said. Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity. Russian navy officials said the mini-submarine, trapped at a depth of 190 meters (625 feet), had seven sailors aboard, and it was unclear how long their oxygen supply would last.
