The most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory. The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands-free devices. Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident.
