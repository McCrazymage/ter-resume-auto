From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. The prevailing view was that top offensive performances in baseball demanded quick reflexes, good eye-hand coordination, quick feet, flexibility and strong wrists -- not bulky muscles. An FBI special agent, Greg Stejskal, told the news media last month that he had notified Major League Baseball about 10 years ago that steroid use was a developing problem. Indeed, it was probably around 10 years ago that some people in baseball became aware that anabolic steroids were being used by some players.
