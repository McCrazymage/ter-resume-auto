The contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for $ 1,675,000. When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother to put it on the market. MZM, one of Cunningham's top campaign donors, obtained millions in government contracts; the congressman, who also sits on the House intelligence committee, acknowledged to Stern that he had helped MZM win contracts, as he said he has helped other firms. Cunningham said in a statement that he didn't do anything wrong.
