Demonstrators in the southwest of the Caucasus republic of Georgia staged protests Friday against the building of an oil pipeline through their district, a local television station reported. The townspeople complain that convoys of trucks carrying material for the project have wrecked roads in the area and are demanding compensation, the Imedi television station said. They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
