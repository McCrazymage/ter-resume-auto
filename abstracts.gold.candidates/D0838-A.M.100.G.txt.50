A study of Australian drivers found that those using cell phones were four times as likely to be involved in a serious crash regardless of whether they used hands-free devices like earpieces or speaker phones that have been perceived as making talking while driving safer. Because cell phone records are not considered public information, a similar study has not been conducted in the United States. The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands-free device in the car and how often the device was used.
