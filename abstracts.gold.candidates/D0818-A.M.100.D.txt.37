The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two white men they want to question in connection with this week's execution-style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband, in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives, friends and sympathizers of a white-supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the judge's assassination. According to a report in Wednesday's issue of The Chicago Sun-Times, the authorities are also pursuing telephone calls made to Lefkow's home Sunday night from a correctional facility.
