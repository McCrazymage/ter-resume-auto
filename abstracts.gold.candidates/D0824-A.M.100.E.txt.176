Because most breast cancer starts in a milk duct, scientists had theorized that flushing those ducts with fluid might draw out cancerous cells even before they could be spotted on a mammogram. Analyzing cells from milk ducts doesn't reliably detect breast cancer, U.S. researchers reported Tuesday _ dashing hopes that the experimental technique could diagnose high-risk women sooner. ``Ductal lavage should not be recommended to high-risk women as a technique to detect cancer earlier than imaging modalities'' she concluded. The test uncovered clear cancer signs in just 13 percent of the cancerous breasts tested, and possible signs in 42 percent.
