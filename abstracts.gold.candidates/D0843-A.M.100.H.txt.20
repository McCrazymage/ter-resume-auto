Less than 24 hours after publishers announced a July 16 release date for ``Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince'' _British author J.K. Rowling's sixth novel set in the halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry_ it had shot to No. 1 on online bookseller amazon.co.uk's Hot 100 book list. The latest installment in the Harry Potter series won't hit stores for more than six months but it has already topped at least one bookseller's most wanted list and is racking up thousands of advance orders, retailers said Wednesday.
