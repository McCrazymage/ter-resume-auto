The FARC's hostages include politicians, police officers, soldiers and three U.S. contractors whose small plane crashed in rebel-held territory early last year. Augusto Castro, vice president of the Catholic Church's ruling body in Colombia, said he hopes the FARC reacts positively to the offer. The previous administration of President Andres Pastrana held face-to-face peace talks with the FARC for three years inside a safe haven as large as Switzerland in the jungles and cattle country of southern Colombia.
