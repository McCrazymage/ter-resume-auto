``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
