The plan ``recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner,'' cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. It will also give gay couples the right to adopt. Spain ``is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle against centuries of discrimination,'' de la Vega said. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual.
