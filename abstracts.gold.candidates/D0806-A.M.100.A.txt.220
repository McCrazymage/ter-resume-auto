Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life. A vigil was kept at the facility in Pinellas Park; three people were arrested when they tried to enter the hospice. Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing about.'' ``Please, please, please save my little girl,'' said Mary Schindler.
