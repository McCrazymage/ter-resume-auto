The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the 1950s and enlarged four decades later. The Chaldeans, whose 600,000 people represent the majority of Christians in Iraq, are an oriental rite Catholic community. Iraq's Christian parties complain they lack funding and are living in danger ahead of landmark parliamentary elections scheduled for January 30. ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church.
