At the same moment, gunmen attacked an Armenian church, forcing out a security guard and two other people inside the building, the guard said, adding : ``I heard two explosions.'' ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church. In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
