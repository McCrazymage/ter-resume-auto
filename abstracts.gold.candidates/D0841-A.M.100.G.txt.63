The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. ``It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life,'' insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference. Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt.
