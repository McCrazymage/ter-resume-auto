Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three Americans. Before any face-to-face meeting can take place, however, the rebels must agree to swap 15 hostages for 15 rebels jailed on minor charges, said Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo. The previous administration of President Andres Pastrana held face-to-face peace talks with the FARC for three years inside a safe haven as large as Switzerland in the jungles and cattle country of southern Colombia.
