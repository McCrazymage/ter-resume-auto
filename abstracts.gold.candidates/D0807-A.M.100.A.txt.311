Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting ``that such information was not widely known,'' the indictment said. She learned that Plame was a CIA employee from yet another government official and advised Libby. Names of two of the others were disclosed by a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the identities have not been publicly released. This person, identified as ``Official A,'' also spoke about Plame's job and identity with columnist Robert Novak a few days before Novak's column appeared.
