The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric-ton giant aloft at about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport here. In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour. ``The takeoff went perfectly,'' Alain Garcia, an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in Paris. Its comparative lack of noise was the result of demands by customers that Airbus make the plane even more quiet than it already was, a process that took six months.
