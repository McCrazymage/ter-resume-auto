Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L 'Equipe's story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's National Research Institute. But she believes the paper's use of this as evidence is unethical. Ayotte suggested this hadn't been the case with the findings used by L 'Equipe to back up their story. The exploits of seven-times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong, who is alleged to have used the banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) in 1999, are also down to the use of other banned substances according to one expert.
