Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday. ``Sandra continues to enable our lifesaving work and is a model for personal generosity,'' said Marsha J. Evans, the American Red Cross president. Stars of sound and cinema in Canada are getting in on the fundraising act to help victims of the tsunami, it is reported here Thursday. Canadian record label Nettwerk Management has enlisted some of its big guns to perform in benefit concerts at the end of the month.
