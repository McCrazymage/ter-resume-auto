Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources. Violation of safety rules was attributed to Sunday's deadly colliery gas blast that killed 16 persons in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, investigators said here Tuesday. The accident happened at Taiping Coal Mine of Qingxu County, when 25 persons were working underground.
