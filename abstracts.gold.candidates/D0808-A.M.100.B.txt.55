Two churches in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul came under simultaneous attack on Tuesday, witnesses and clerics said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. ``We were then taken outside and the armed men set off the devices. We heard three blasts,'' he told AFP outside the church which was set ablaze. The Chaldeans, whose 600,000 people represent the majority of Christians in Iraq, are an oriental rite Catholic community.
