Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. Official statistics said that from January to September this year, 4,228 people were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time.
