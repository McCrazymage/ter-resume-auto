The plan ``recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner,'' cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Church.
