The rediscovery ``is thrilling beyond words'', John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, told reporters. The first sighting of the spectacular bird is reported to be on Feb. 11, 2004, and has been followed by several others, including one on April 25, 2004, in which the bird was videotaped. So the news that the magnificent bird has been found in an Arkansas swamp -- six decades after it was thought to be extinct in the United States -- hit the Nature Conservancy ecologist like a thunderclap.
