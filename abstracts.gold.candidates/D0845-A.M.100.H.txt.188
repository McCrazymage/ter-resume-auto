The rediscovery ``is thrilling beyond words'', John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, told reporters. The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. Twenty years ago, Chris Pague picked up a stuffed specimen of an ivory-billed woodpecker and marveled at what had been lost. ``This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation,'' he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
