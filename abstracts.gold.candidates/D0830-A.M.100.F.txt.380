Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
