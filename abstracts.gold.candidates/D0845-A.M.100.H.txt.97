``The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), long suspected to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the' Big Woods' region of eastern Arkansas'', researchers reported in the journal Science to be published.

Twenty years ago, Chris Pague picked up a stuffed specimen of an ivory-billed woodpecker and marveled at what had been lost.
