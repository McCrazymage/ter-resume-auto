On Capitol Hill, lawmakers vowed to swiftly overhaul the oversight of the federally chartered company. Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations. The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Raines after the announcement by the SEC's top accountant that the company had violated two rules. The company declined to comment further about the findings of the SEC staff or the remarks of lawmakers.
