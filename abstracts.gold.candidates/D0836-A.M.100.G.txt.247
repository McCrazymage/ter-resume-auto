Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the preserve's director. The stage begins when the bamboo forms flowers, after which the pandas refuse to eat it. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
