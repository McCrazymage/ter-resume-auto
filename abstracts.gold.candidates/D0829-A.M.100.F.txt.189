The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement. Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday. Plans are in the works for several big concerts, with the proceeds going to various charities involved in the tsunami relief effort. Canadian Television will broadcast January 29 concert live from Vancouver.
