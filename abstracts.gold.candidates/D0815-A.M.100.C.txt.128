Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., meanwhile, has said the right to filibuster must remain intact and President Bush must withdraw three of his most contentious appellate court nominees. Nelson said that the details of his plan remain fluid, but that it would leave the filibuster rules intact while confirming more of Bush's nominees than Reid has said his party can accept. But both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue -- often called ``the nuclear option'' -- as early as next week, if not Friday.
