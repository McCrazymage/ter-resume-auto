Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday. Orhan Pamuk, who has won a number of international awards in literature, will go on trial in Istanbul on Friday for ``insulting'' Turkey. The European Union (EU) sent a clear warning to Turkey on Thursday over the trial of a well-known novelist, saying it would affect the Muslim country's EU accession process.
