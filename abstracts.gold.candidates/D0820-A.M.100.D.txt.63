The ships include one submarine tender and three minesweepers, Marine Self Defense Force spokesman Hidetsubu Iwamasa said. Russian navy officials said the mini-submarine, trapped at a depth of 190 meters (625 feet), had seven sailors aboard, and it was unclear how long their oxygen supply would last. In televised comments, Pacific Fleet spokesman Capt. Alexander Kosolapov said there was contact with the sailors, who were not hurt, and that authorities were preparing to send down a similar vessel to assess the situation.
