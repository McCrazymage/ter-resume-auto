Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying-off stage. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
