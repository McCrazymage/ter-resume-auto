The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
