The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the 1950s and enlarged four decades later. ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church.
