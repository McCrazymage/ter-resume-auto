Earlier this year, Starlet Travis voted Republican in the U.S. Senate race here. That scene is playing out all across Illinois as this race makes history : It's the first time in a U.S. Senate race that the candidates from the two major parties are black. On one side is a Harvard-educated attorney and long-time Illinois resident who practiced civil rights law. While no one says the race is close, it is nevertheless one of the highly watched political contests this season.
