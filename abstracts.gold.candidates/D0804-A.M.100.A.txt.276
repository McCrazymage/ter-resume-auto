Molly was stranded in the floodwaters that submerged New Orleans East. Five days passed, said Laura Maloney, director of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before the New Orleans police, National Guard soldiers and a man named Joe with a boat found their way to the house. Within 24 hours dog and owner were reunited in Lake Charles, La. Maloney said the center received at least 700 animals on Monday alone.
