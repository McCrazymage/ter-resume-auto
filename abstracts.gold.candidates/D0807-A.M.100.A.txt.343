In no case other than Libby's does the indictment contend that one of the government employees provided the name to reporters. Cheney told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, information that Libby understood came from the agency, the indictment said. The person referred to as ``then White House press secretary'' is Ari Fleischer. Names of two of the others were disclosed by a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the identities have not been publicly released. The identity of the other government official remains a secret.
