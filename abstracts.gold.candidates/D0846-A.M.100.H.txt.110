``We estimate there are almost 800,000 faithful at the moment, but people continue to fill up the Blonia esplanadae,'' said police spokeswoman Sylwia Bober. Magee was private secretary to John Paul II from his election in 1978 until 1982 when he was succeeded by Polish Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, who was at the pontiff's bedside when he died last Saturday. The next pope should not try to be another John Paul II, the Polish-born pope's first private secretary, Irish Bishop John Magee, said Thursday.
