Some 300 supporters of a candidate who lost his bid for a parliament seat to the daughter of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev gathered in central Bishkek, in the words of one, to ``hold a peaceful meeting to defend freedom of speech and honest elections.'' Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. Opposition supporters in Kyrgyzstan have held protests for more than a week since a March 13 run-off election that saw the opposition presence in the 75-member parliament reduced to a mere handful of seats.
