ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas. The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. It's ready to meet the demands of 20 million Texans; ready to deal with another peak day like that of Aug. 7, 2003, when the state's electrical usage reached a record 60,095 megawatts. Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the state because the system isn't connected to other major grids in North America.
