Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity. Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help. All seven crew members were alive and rushed aboard a Russian surface vessel, where they were being examined by a medical team, Russian news agencies and the U.S. Navy said.
