``If nothing hits him again, or nothing else has appeared in the meanwhile, I guess he has a fair and great likelihood of making a full recovery,'' Dr Michael Zimpfer, the president of Vienna's Rudolfinerhaus Hospital where Yushchenko was treated, told AFP. Zimpfer said Yushchenko, whose skin has been discoloured and pockmarked by the illness, was also likely to regain the good looks for which he is noted. Zimpfer said the hospital had found no evidence of poisoning and neither had a medical insitute in the United States to which they referred the case within days.
