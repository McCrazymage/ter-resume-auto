The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. The plan ``recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner,'' cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. ``It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life,'' insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference.
