The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. The plan ``recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner,'' cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual.
