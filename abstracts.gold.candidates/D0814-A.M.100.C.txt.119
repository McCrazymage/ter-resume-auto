He added that he would hold a meeting in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with Nigerian president and current AU Chairman Olusegun Obasanjo to map out an urgent plan to send more African troups to Darfur. Khartoum must take serious steps to implement the United Nations resolutions on Darfur and specify the areas for its army and the militias in the region, said Blair. The prime minister denied that any of the European countries has desire to send troops to Darfur, stressing the capability of the African forces to control the situation in Darfur.
