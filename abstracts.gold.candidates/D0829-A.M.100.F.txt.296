Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday. The star of ``Speed'' and ``While You Were Sleeping'' also gave one million dollars after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Plans are in the works for several big concerts, with the proceeds going to various charities involved in the tsunami relief effort. Canadian record label Nettwerk Management has enlisted some of its big guns to perform in benefit concerts at the end of the month.
