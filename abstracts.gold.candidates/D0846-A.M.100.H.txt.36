Magee was private secretary to John Paul II from his election in 1978 until 1982 when he was succeeded by Polish Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, who was at the pontiff's bedside when he died last Saturday. ``He left something very special for me, as a sign of his gratitude, but I'm not prepared to say what it is,'' he said, adding that Dziwisz had given it to him on his arrival in Rome on Sunday.
