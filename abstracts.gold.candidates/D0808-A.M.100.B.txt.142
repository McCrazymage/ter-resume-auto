At the same moment, gunmen attacked an Armenian church, forcing out a security guard and two other people inside the building, the guard said, adding : ``I heard two explosions.'' Iraq's Christian parties complain they lack funding and are living in danger ahead of landmark parliamentary elections scheduled for January 30. ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church.
