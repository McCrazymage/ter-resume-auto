But when rescue workers airlifted the owner last week, Molly, a black Labrador seeing-eye dog, was left behind. An animal-control officer in waders stepped into water that still rose halfway up the first floor, and she climbed the stairs. ``She saw a black nose peeking around the corner,'' said Maloneywhose office also handles animal control for the city.
