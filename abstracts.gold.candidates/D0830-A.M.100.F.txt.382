Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
