The police refused to discuss whether these men might be connected to the hate groups that have been a prime focus of the investigation. The authorities would not say where or when the two men, one in his mid-20s and the other aged 50 to 60, were seen or whether they were suspects or witnesses. ``They know where I was and I 've been cleared,'' David Hale said Wednesday. According to a report in Wednesday's issue of The Chicago Sun-Times, the authorities are also pursuing telephone calls made to Lefkow's home Sunday night from a correctional facility.
