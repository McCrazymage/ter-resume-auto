Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., meanwhile, has said the right to filibuster must remain intact and President Bush must withdraw three of his most contentious appellate court nominees. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' But both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue -- often called ``the nuclear option'' -- as early as next week, if not Friday.
