Stewart will complete the second week of a five-month prison term Friday for lying to the federal government about a stock transaction. Ana Marengo, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society in New York, said Stewart and her company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, have long had a team that participates in an annual walk in Central Park -- ``Making Strides'' -- to raise money for breast cancer research. Stewart participated with her team in last year's walk, Marengo said.
