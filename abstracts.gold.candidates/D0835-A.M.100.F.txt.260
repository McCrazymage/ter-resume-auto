From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. Commissioner Bud Selig and Major League Baseball have taken a lot of heat over the last several months for their supposed failure to grapple forthrightly with the sport's steroid problem. At the time, many anabolic steroids were illegal if purchased without a prescription. Indeed, it was probably around 10 years ago that some people in baseball became aware that anabolic steroids were being used by some players.
