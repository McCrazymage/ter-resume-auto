Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item. ``There is so much demand people want to make sure they get their copy,'' Marino said. Jo Marino, a spokeswoman for Waterstones bookstore chain, said customers had started calling its stores to place orders for the book immediately after publishers announced the release date Tuesday.
