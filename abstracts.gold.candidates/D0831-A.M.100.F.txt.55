Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three Americans. ``All we 're looking for is a minimum sign of hope and we will start the ball rolling,'' Restrepo told local radio. ``This proposal addresses the need to find a solution at a time when we are all concerned about being on a street with no exits,'' said Castro.
