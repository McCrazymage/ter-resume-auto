If you want Medicare to help you compare drug plans, here are a few suggestions. 1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your medications handy. The fastest way to talk to a live person is to select ``enrollment.'' 5) Tell the agent you want a list of stand-alone drug plans and their costs to you, based on your particular medications. Make sure the agent types in your specific medications before comparing plan costs.
