Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. Blair told reporters that the African monitoring forces must be expanded by sending thousands of troops to ensure ceasefire agreement and access of true information on the situation in Darfur. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said. The prime minister denied that any of the European countries has desire to send troops to Darfur, stressing the capability of the African forces to control the situation in Darfur.
