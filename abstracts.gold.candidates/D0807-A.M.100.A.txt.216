Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting ``that such information was not widely known,'' the indictment said. The identity of the other government official remains a secret. This person, identified as ``Official A,'' also spoke about Plame's job and identity with columnist Robert Novak a few days before Novak's column appeared.
