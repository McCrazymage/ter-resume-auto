Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. However, the cycle seems to run along different schedules in different places and an earlier mass die-off of bamboo in the 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 pandas, Xinhua said. Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of the 220,000-hectare (544,000-acre) preserve, Xinhua said. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation.
