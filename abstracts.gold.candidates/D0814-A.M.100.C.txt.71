Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he said. The prime minister denied that any of the European countries has desire to send troops to Darfur, stressing the capability of the African forces to control the situation in Darfur.
