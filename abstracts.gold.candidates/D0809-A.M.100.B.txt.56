``It ends the speculation,'' said Leonard Garment, who served as acting White House counsel during the investigation into the Watergate break-in, and published a book called ``In Search of Deep Throat'' in 2000. But then-deputy White House counsel Fred Fielding, onetime Nixon aide Alexander Haig, speechwriter Patrick Buchanan and many others who have been mentioned as possible candidates -- in some cases based on circumstantial evidence at best -- may finally face fewer questions about the famous disclosures of over three decades ago. Another strain of thought focused on officials in the FBI.
