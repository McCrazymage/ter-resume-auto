ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas. The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the state because the system isn't connected to other major grids in North America.
