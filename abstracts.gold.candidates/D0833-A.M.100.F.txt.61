India plans to put a 525 kg orbiter using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket 100 km over the moon to explore the earth's satellite. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has short-listed experiments from five nations including the United States, Britain and Germany, for a slot on India's unmanned moon mission Chandrayaan-1 to be undertaken by 2006-2007, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday. ``The best suited proposals have been short listed. We have to find out whether they finally fit into our mission payload,'' the sources said.
