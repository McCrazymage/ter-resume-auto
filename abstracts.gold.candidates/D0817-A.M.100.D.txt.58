L 'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined ``Armstrong's Lie'' suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999. Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L 'Equipe's story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's National Research Institute. The exploits of seven-times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong, who is alleged to have used the banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) in 1999, are also down to the use of other banned substances according to one expert.
