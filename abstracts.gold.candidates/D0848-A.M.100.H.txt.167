Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this. ``The trial of a novelist who expressed a non-violent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU,'' EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement. Rehn said Turkey should make serious efforts in bringing its legislation in line with EU laws, including the European Convention of Human Rights.
