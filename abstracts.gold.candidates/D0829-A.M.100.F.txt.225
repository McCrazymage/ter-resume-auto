The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement. ``Sandra continues to enable our lifesaving work and is a model for personal generosity,'' said Marsha J. Evans, the American Red Cross president. Plans are in the works for several big concerts, with the proceeds going to various charities involved in the tsunami relief effort. Canadian Television will broadcast January 29 concert live from Vancouver.
