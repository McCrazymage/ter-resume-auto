The contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for $ 1,675,000. When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother to put it on the market. He said the sale price was based on ``comparables from an independent source'' -- but it turns out that source was a real estate agent whose family also has contributed heavily to Cunningham; Wade simply paid the asking price.
