West-leaning Yushchenko, who Wednesday called for a fresh vote as official results showed Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich had defeated him in Sunday's presidential election, was admitted to the private Austrian hospital in September suffering from a severe gastro-intestinal illness. His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich. Zimpfer said the hospital had found no evidence of poisoning and neither had a medical insitute in the United States to which they referred the case within days.
