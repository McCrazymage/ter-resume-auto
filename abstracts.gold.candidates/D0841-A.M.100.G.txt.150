But according to an opinion poll conducted in late July, some two-thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and now the cabinet has approved the bill such liaisons could become legal from as early as next year. Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Church.
