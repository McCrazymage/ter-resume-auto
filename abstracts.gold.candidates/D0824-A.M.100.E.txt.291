To test it, doctors at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital administered ductal lavage to 39 women just before their breasts were removed for known cancer. Doctors put an anesthetic on the nipple and inserted a threadlike catheter to flush milk ducts with fluid that dislodges and draws out cells. The milk duct technique, called ductal lavage, is among those experimental alternatives. Ductal lavage signaled cancer in only a fraction of these women, lead researcher Dr. Seema Khan reported Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
