``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991.
