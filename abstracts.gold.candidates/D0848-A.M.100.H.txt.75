Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. The charges stem from his remarks in an interview with a Swiss newspaper in which he said ``30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in Turkey'' during World War I and in the 1980s and 1990s. ``The trial of a novelist who expressed a non-violent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU,'' EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement.
