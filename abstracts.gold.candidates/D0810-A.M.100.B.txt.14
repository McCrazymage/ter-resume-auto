Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike on Thursday demanded that senior executives, including the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, return tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation that they had earned based on inaccurate financial statements that the company issued from 2001 until this year. But people involved in the inquiry said that board members know that they can not let the uncertainty hanging over Raines linger, both for the sake of the company and the markets, and predicted that a decision would be made soon.
