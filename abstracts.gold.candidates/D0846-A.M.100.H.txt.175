Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to ``be himself.'' ``I think it would be very wrong if a new pope would try to emulate what John Paul II had,'' he said. The next pope should not try to be another John Paul II, the Polish-born pope's first private secretary, Irish Bishop John Magee, said Thursday.
