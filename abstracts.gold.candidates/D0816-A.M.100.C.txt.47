North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. The offer came last week in Laos during a meeting of Asian foreign ministers, according to Radio Pyongyang, monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. North Korea declared on February 10 it possessed nuclear weapons and said it needed them as a deterrent to what it said were US plans to launch a nuclear attack against it.
