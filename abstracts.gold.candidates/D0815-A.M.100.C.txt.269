Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., meanwhile, has said the right to filibuster must remain intact and President Bush must withdraw three of his most contentious appellate court nominees. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise.
