North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. North Korea declared on February 10 it possessed nuclear weapons and said it needed them as a deterrent to what it said were US plans to launch a nuclear attack against it. North Korea on Monday proposed resuming six-nation talks on its nuclear program during the week of September 12, a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the North's official KCNA news agency as saying.
