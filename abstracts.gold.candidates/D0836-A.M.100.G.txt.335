Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the preserve's director. Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying-off stage. The stage begins when the bamboo forms flowers, after which the pandas refuse to eat it. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation.
