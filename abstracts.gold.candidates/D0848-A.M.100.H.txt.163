Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. Orhan Pamuk, who has won a number of international awards in literature, will go on trial in Istanbul on Friday for ``insulting'' Turkey. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this. Rehn said Turkey should make serious efforts in bringing its legislation in line with EU laws, including the European Convention of Human Rights.
