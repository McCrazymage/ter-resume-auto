Some 800,000 people were gathering Thursday in a vast field on the edge of the southern Polish city of Krakow for a mass in memory of Pope John Paul II, a police spokeswoman said. The next pope should not try to be another John Paul II, the Polish-born pope's first private secretary, Irish Bishop John Magee, said Thursday.
