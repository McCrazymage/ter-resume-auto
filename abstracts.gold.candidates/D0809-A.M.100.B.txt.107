Two years ago, after a four-year investigation, a journalism class at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign found ``Fielding to be the most likely Throat candidate,'' according to a summary on deepthroatuncovered.com. Fielding, who according to media reports had denied that he was Deep Throat, could not be reached for comment. Tuesday, after Woodward confirmed that Felt was Deep Throat, William Gaines, the professor involved, said he and his students accepted that. Another strain of thought focused on officials in the FBI.
