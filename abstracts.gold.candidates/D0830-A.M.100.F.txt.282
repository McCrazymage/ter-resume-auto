``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
