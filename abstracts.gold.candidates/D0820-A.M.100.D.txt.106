Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity. Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the U.S. Navy has also been asked for assistance, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported. The Russian submarine had been tending an underwater antenna mounted to the sea floor when it became snagged on a wire helping to stabilize a ventilation cable attached to the antenna, the official said.
