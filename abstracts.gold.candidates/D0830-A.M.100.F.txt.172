Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. ``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match.
