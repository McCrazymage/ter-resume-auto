Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy held a crisis meeting Friday on running riots that have plunged France into its worst explosion of urban violence in decades. She was allegedly doused with petrol by one youth, then others threw a flaming rag on her. Overnight Thursday, more than 600 vehicles and several businesses were set on fire, and 78 people arrested in the Paris area, according to police.
