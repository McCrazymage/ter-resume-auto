In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin, Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas. As the first hot days of Texas summer count down to the scorching temperatures of late July and August, ERCOT managers say the grid is prepared. Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast.
