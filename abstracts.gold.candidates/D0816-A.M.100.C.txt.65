North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. Similar remarks were made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il last month during a meeting with a South Korean envoy. The Korean negotiations -- bringing together the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia -- are to resume near the end of this month.
