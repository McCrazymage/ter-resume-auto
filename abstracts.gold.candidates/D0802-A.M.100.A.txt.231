``There is some tough sledding ahead to make the rest of the cuts in greenhouse gases that will be needed,'' said Chief Gary Harrison, a council member, at a meeting in Copenhagen.

The treaty has been ratified by at least 140 nations. ``To some, that's just the difference between putting a jacket on and off,'' said Clive Tesar, of the council's Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat.
