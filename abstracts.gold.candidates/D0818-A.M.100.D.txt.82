Evelyn Hutcheson and David Hale, the mother and brother of Matthew Hale, the man convicted last year of plotting the murder of the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow, said Wednesday that federal agents had asked them whether Hale might have communicated something from prison in code. Hutcheson, recalled the agents asking Tuesday at her home in East Peoria, Ill., ``Does he have a code, did he tell me something in code, which is about the dumbest thing I 've ever heard.'' ``They know where I was and I 've been cleared,'' David Hale said Wednesday.
