The White House announced Saturday night that President Bush would fly to Washington from his Texas ranch Sunday to sign the emergency legislation. Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing about.'' ``Please, please, please save my little girl,'' said Mary Schindler. With the clock running down on how much longer Terri Schiavo can remain alive, congressional leaders Saturday announced an unprecedented agreement that would allow Schiavo's parents to petition the federal courts to have a feeding tube replaced for their brain-damaged daughter.
