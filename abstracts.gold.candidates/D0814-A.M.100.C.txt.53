Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. The prime minister called on the Sudanese government to commit to the humanitarian protocol it reached with the Darfur rebels in Nigerian capital of Abuja in September and to help humanitarian aid reach affected people of Darfur. He added that he would hold a meeting in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with Nigerian president and current AU Chairman Olusegun Obasanjo to map out an urgent plan to send more African troups to Darfur.
