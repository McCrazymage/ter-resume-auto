French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the ``total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380.'' In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes, but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
