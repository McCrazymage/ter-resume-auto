A study of Australian drivers found that those using cell phones were four times as likely to be involved in a serious crash regardless of whether they used hands-free devices like earpieces or speaker phones that have been perceived as making talking while driving safer. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
