When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother to put it on the market. He then put the house back on the market, where it languished for 261 days before selling for $ 700,000 less than the original purchase price. Cunningham, meanwhile, upgraded to a $2.55 million house, with 7 1/2 baths and a five-car garage. Government contracts for the company, whose Web site describes it as helping solve ``enigmatic problems ... in the areas of intelligence collection and analysis,'' grew from $41 million in 2003 to $66 million in 2004, according to Washington Technology magazine.
