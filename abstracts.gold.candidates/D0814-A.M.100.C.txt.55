Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. The prime minister called on the Sudanese government to commit to the humanitarian protocol it reached with the Darfur rebels in Nigerian capital of Abuja in September and to help humanitarian aid reach affected people of Darfur. The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he said.
