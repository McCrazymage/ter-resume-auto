Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. Paul told journalists after meeting Taylor : ``He said' there will be tremendous destabilisation in Liberia if the extradition takes place '.'' ``There is no question in my mind that there will be chaos,'' added Paul. However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his guru Paul.
