Hurricane Katrina could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars (40 billion euros), British company Brit Insurance forecast on Tuesday. The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani decided on Saturday to contribute 100 million US dollars to the victims of the Katrina hurricane in the United States. Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters.
