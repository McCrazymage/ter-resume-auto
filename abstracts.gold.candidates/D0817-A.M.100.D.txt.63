L 'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined ``Armstrong's Lie'' suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999. ``The stablity of EPO in urine isn't as long as five years according to our testing here in Montreal. It's more a matter of months,'' stressed Ayotte, whose testing centre is accredited to WADA, the world's anti-doping agency. In such a case she argued you had to have the possibility of carrying out a second B Sample test to verify the result.
