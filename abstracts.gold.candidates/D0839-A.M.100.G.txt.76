Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his guru Paul. Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
