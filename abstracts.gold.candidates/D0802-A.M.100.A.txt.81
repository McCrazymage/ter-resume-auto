``There is some tough sledding ahead to make the rest of the cuts in greenhouse gases that will be needed,'' said Chief Gary Harrison, a council member, at a meeting in Copenhagen. The eight-nation Arctic Council said the annual average amount of sea ice around the North Pole has decreased about 8 percent in 30 years because of global warming fueled by greenhouse gas emissions. The protocol, which took effect in February, commits participating industrialized nations to reduce their combined greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 percent below 1990 levels by 2012.
