The rediscovery ``is thrilling beyond words'', John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, told reporters. The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. So the news that the magnificent bird has been found in an Arkansas swamp -- six decades after it was thought to be extinct in the United States -- hit the Nature Conservancy ecologist like a thunderclap. ``This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation,'' he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
