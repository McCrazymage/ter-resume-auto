Amazon could not say exactly how many pre-orders it had gotten, but the company said its Web site had been deluged after it began taking orders for the novel late Tuesday. ``The fact that the book has already hit No. 1 in our Hot 100 books chart shows how incredibly excited customers are about the sixth Harry Potter,'' amazon.co.uk managing director Robin Terrell said. Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item.
