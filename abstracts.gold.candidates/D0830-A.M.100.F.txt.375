Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
