``There is some tough sledding ahead to make the rest of the cuts in greenhouse gases that will be needed,'' said Chief Gary Harrison, a council member, at a meeting in Copenhagen. The eight-nation Arctic Council said the annual average amount of sea ice around the North Pole has decreased about 8 percent in 30 years because of global warming fueled by greenhouse gas emissions. The council believes temperatures in the Arctic will increase 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2080.
