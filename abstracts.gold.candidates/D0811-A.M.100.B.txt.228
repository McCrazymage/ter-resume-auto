The planet is a typical member of the Kuiper belt, but its sheer size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be classified as a planet, Brown said. But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of ``planet'' and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. Because it was moving, astronomers ruled it was a moon and not a background star, which is stationary. The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet's mass.
