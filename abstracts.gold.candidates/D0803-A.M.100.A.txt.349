The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide. Violation of safety rules was attributed to Sunday's deadly colliery gas blast that killed 16 persons in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, investigators said here Tuesday. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
