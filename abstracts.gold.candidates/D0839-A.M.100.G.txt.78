Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media. Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
