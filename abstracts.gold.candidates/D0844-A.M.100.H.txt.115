Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.'' The president made it clear Friday that he has no intention of backing down. ``He has put up an unknown and undistinguished figure for an opening that conservatives worked for a generation to see filled with a jurist of high distinction,'' the magazine's editor Bill Kristol wrote.
