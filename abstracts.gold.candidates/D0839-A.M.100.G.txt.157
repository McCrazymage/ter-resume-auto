Taylor met Wednesday with the renowned Indian evangelist Kilari Anand Paul in the eastern city of Calabar an AFP correspondent saw -- as pressure rose on Nigeria to extradite him to face war crimes charges. Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media. Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
