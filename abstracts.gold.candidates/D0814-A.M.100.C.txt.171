Blair told reporters that the African monitoring forces must be expanded by sending thousands of troops to ensure ceasefire agreement and access of true information on the situation in Darfur. The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he said. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said. Blair described his talks with Sudanese officials as constructive, urging the conflicting sides in Darfur to fulfill their commitments within a week or a month.
