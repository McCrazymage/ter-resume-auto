A three-member Afghan delegation is in Bangalore seeking help to set up a high-tech telemedicine facility in 10 Afghan cities linked via Indian satellites, Indo-Asian News Service reported Saturday. The satellite-based networks that will be established later this year with the help of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) will offer connectivity to major hospitals in India to improve healthcare in the war-ravaged country. ISRO had allotted 10 kgs and 10 watts of power for space agencies of other nations and had invited international bids for the purpose that had evoked 15 responses from 10 nations.
