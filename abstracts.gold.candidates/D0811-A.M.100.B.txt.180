The body is ``the 10th planet of the solar system,'' said Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech in the town of Pasadena. ``It's definitely bigger than Pluto,'' he said of the body made up of ice and rock. Currently about 97 times further from the sun than the Earth, the planet is the farthest-known object in the solar system, and the third brightest of the Kuiper belt objects. Because it was moving, astronomers ruled it was a moon and not a background star, which is stationary.
