Because cell phone records are not considered public information, a similar study has not been conducted in the United States. The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands-free devices. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone.
