Demonstrators in the southwest of the Caucasus republic of Georgia staged protests Friday against the building of an oil pipeline through their district, a local television station reported. BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
