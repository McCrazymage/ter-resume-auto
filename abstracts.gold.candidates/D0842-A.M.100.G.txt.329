BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
