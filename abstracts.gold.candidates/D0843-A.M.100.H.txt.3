The list, calculated from all orders placed by customers on the retailer's Internet site, put the latest chapter in the boy wizard fantasy series ahead of best sellers such as Dan Brown's ``The Da Vinci Code.'' Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item.
