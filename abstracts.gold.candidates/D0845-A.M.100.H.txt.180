The rediscovery ``is thrilling beyond words'', John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, told reporters. The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. The first sighting of the spectacular bird is reported to be on Feb. 11, 2004, and has been followed by several others, including one on April 25, 2004, in which the bird was videotaped. The black-and- white bird, with a nearly one-meter wingspan and its distinctive ivory-colored bill, is larger than the more common pileated woodpecker that is similar in appearance.
