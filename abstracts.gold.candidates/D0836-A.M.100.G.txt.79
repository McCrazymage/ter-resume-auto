Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
