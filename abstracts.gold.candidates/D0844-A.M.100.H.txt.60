President Bush Friday rejected conservative calls to withdraw his nomination of White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and prepared to reassure skeptical Republicans and persuade the Senate to confirm her for the seat of retiring Justice Sandra Day O 'Connor. Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.'' Conservative outrage over President George W. Bush's controversial pick of Texas lawyer Harriet Miers to fill a vacancy on the US Supreme Court was unabated Sunday as activists called on the White House to withdraw her nomination.
