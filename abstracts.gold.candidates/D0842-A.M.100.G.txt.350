Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline. In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
