The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric-ton giant aloft at about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport here. French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the ``total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380.'' The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. ``The takeoff went perfectly,'' Alain Garcia, an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in Paris. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes, but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
