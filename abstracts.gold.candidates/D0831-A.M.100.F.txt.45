Colombia's hardline government said Friday it is willing to meet with members of the country's main leftist rebel group in an unprecedented offer aimed at freeing dozens of rebel hostages, including three Americans. Despite mistrust on both sides, Restrepo said the government is willing to release the 15 jailed rebels first, provided the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, at least expresses a willingness to reciprocate. ``All we 're looking for is a minimum sign of hope and we will start the ball rolling,'' Restrepo told local radio.
