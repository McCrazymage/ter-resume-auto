They don't work as well on the more dense breast tissue of women under 50, so scientists are testing alternatives like MRI scans to screen younger women at high risk of cancer because a close relative had it. Mammograms work very well at detecting early breast cancer, but they 're not perfect. Ductal lavage signaled cancer in only a fraction of these women, lead researcher Dr. Seema Khan reported Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. ``Ductal lavage should not be recommended to high-risk women as a technique to detect cancer earlier than imaging modalities'' she concluded.
