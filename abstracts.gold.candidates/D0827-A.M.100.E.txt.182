``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Katrina will have ``a profound impact on (insurance) market conditions'', Douetil added. Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars. Hurricane Katrina caused a first fatality in southeastern Florida Thursday when it sent a tree crashing on the roof of a car in Fort Lauderdale, local television reported.
