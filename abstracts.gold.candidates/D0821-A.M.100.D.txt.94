The bus explosion was one of four co-ordinated bombings, the others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in the morning rush hour. ``There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top of it,'' a ``senior police source'' told the paper. According to The Times, a single bomb maker using military-grade explosives was most likely responsible for manufacturing all the bombs used in the attacks.
