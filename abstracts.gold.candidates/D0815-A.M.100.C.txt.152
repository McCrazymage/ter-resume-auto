Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' Frist, noting that four of the controversial nominations could be called to the Senate floor any time, told reporters that ``the suggestion has been made, let's go straight through the executive calendar and deal with them one by one. And I think it's time to do that.'' But both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue -- often called ``the nuclear option'' -- as early as next week, if not Friday.
