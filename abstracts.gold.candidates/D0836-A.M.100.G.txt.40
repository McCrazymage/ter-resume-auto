Giant pandas in western China could be at risk of starvation because the bamboo plants that they eat are beginning to die off in a cycle that happens about every 60 years, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation.
