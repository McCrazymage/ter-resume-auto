Analyzing cells from milk ducts doesn't reliably detect breast cancer, U.S. researchers reported Tuesday _ dashing hopes that the experimental technique could diagnose high-risk women sooner. Mammograms work very well at detecting early breast cancer, but they 're not perfect. To test it, doctors at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital administered ductal lavage to 39 women just before their breasts were removed for known cancer. The milk duct technique, called ductal lavage, is among those experimental alternatives. The test uncovered clear cancer signs in just 13 percent of the cancerous breasts tested, and possible signs in 42 percent.
