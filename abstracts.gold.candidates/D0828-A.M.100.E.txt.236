( c) 2004, Newsday= NEW YORK -- Martha Stewart says she has been deluged by ``thousands'' of letters from fans sent to her federal prison camp in Alderson, W.V., some of which have even included gifts and money. However Zobel said inmate mail is subject to inspection for contraband or other banned items before it leaves the prison's postal facility. Dawn Zobel, a public information officer at Alderson, said she could neither confirm nor deny that Stewart has been the recipient of such a tsunami of mail. Stewart participated with her team in last year's walk, Marengo said.
