Because most breast cancer starts in a milk duct, scientists had theorized that flushing those ducts with fluid might draw out cancerous cells even before they could be spotted on a mammogram. Mammograms work very well at detecting early breast cancer, but they 're not perfect.

Doctors put an anesthetic on the nipple and inserted a threadlike catheter to flush milk ducts with fluid that dislodges and draws out cells.
