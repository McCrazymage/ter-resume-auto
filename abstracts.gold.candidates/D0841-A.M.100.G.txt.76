The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. Spain ``is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle against centuries of discrimination,'' de la Vega said. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Church.
