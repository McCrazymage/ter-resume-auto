Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary election dominated by pro-presidential forces simmered for a second week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye.
