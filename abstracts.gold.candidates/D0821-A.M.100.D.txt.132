British police are on the verge of identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday. ``There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top of it,'' a ``senior police source'' told the paper. ``The nature of the explosives appears to be military, which is very worrying,'' Superintendent Christophe Chaboud, head of France's anti-terrorism police, who is helping the London inquiry, was quoted as saying.
