L 'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined ``Armstrong's Lie'' suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999. Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L 'Equipe's story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's National Research Institute. Ayotte though was quick not to cast doubts on the testing procedures of the French laboratory cited in the L 'Equipe report. But she believes the paper's use of this as evidence is unethical.
