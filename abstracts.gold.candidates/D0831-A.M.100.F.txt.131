The FARC's hostages include politicians, police officers, soldiers and three U.S. contractors whose small plane crashed in rebel-held territory early last year. Before any face-to-face meeting can take place, however, the rebels must agree to swap 15 hostages for 15 rebels jailed on minor charges, said Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo. ``This proposal addresses the need to find a solution at a time when we are all concerned about being on a street with no exits,'' said Castro.
