Of course, the ``vice president of the United States'' is Dick Cheney, for whom Libby worked as chief of staff. Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting ``that such information was not widely known,'' the indictment said. She learned that Plame was a CIA employee from yet another government official and advised Libby. This person, identified as ``Official A,'' also spoke about Plame's job and identity with columnist Robert Novak a few days before Novak's column appeared.
