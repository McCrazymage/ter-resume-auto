Gangs of youths have gone on the rampage since October 27, when two teenagers were electrocuted in a tough, low-income suburb north of Paris as they hid in an electrical sub-station to flee a police identity check. Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy held a crisis meeting Friday on running riots that have plunged France into its worst explosion of urban violence in decades. According to prosecutors Friday, a 56-year-old woman was unable to get off a bus targeted by a Molotov cocktail late Wednesday in the northern Paris suburb of Sevran.
