The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
