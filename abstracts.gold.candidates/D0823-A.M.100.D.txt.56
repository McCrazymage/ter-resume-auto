Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising the case said Wednesday. His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich. Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no idea as to what caused them.
