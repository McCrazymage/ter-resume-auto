From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. Commissioner Bud Selig and Major League Baseball have taken a lot of heat over the last several months for their supposed failure to grapple forthrightly with the sport's steroid problem. They would benefit from taking a step back and looking more carefully at the evolution of the steroid problem in baseball. At the time, many anabolic steroids were illegal if purchased without a prescription.
