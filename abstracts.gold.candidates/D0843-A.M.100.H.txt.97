Rowling's sixth novel set in the halls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry_ it had shot to No. 1 on online bookseller amazon.co.uk's Hot 100 book list. ``There is so much demand people want to make sure they get their copy,'' Marino said. She said when the last Potter book went on sale, Waterstones' central London store started selling it just after midnight and had sold 2,000 copies within two hours.
