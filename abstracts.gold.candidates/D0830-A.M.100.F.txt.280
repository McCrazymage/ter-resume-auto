``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
