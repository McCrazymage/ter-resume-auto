Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Nelson said that the details of his plan remain fluid, but that it would leave the filibuster rules intact while confirming more of Bush's nominees than Reid has said his party can accept. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' But Republicans said Democrats have a history of labeling mainstream conservatives as extremists.
