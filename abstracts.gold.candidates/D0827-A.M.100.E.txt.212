Hurricane Katrina could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars (40 billion euros), British company Brit Insurance forecast on Tuesday. Katrina will have ``a profound impact on (insurance) market conditions'', Douetil added. Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars. Hurricane Katrina caused a first fatality in southeastern Florida Thursday when it sent a tree crashing on the roof of a car in Fort Lauderdale, local television reported.
