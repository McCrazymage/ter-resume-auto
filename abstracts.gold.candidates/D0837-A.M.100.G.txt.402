Earlier this year, Starlet Travis voted Republican in the U.S. Senate race here. After Travis watched Barack Obama speak at a fundraiser here a few days ago, she rushed to meet him. With a tired smile and dark circles under his eyes, Obama hugged Travis and signed the photograph. That scene is playing out all across Illinois as this race makes history : It's the first time in a U.S. Senate race that the candidates from the two major parties are black. On one side is a Harvard-educated attorney and long-time Illinois resident who practiced civil rights law.
