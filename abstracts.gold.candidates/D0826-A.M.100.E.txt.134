Abramoff is a leading GOP fund-raiser, having collected hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years for House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and other top Republicans. McCain, Campbell and other senators, wielding documents obtained via Senate subpoena, charged that Abramoff and public relations executive Michael Scanlon, a former aide to DeLay, have been running a crude political extortion racket that bilked tribes out of millions of dollars. ``All told, six tribes paid more than $66 million to Mr. Scanlon, and Mr. Abramoff received more than $21 million from Mr. Scanlon for his share of the scheme,'' Campbell said.
