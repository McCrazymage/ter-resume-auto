The rediscovery ``is thrilling beyond words'', John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, told reporters. ``The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), long suspected to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the' Big Woods' region of eastern Arkansas'', researchers reported in the journal Science to be published. The black-and- white bird, with a nearly one-meter wingspan and its distinctive ivory-colored bill, is larger than the more common pileated woodpecker that is similar in appearance. ``This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation,'' he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
