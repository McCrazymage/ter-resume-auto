The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands-free devices. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
