``We really aren't going to know before we do this recount who the governor is going to be,'' said Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who will oversee the recount process. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has ``never seen anything like this before.'' ``It's fun, it's exciting, it's like a two-week playoff series. But it's a lot more important than a ballgame,'' said Joe Arko, a Texas doctor who has been following the Washington election religiously on the Internet.
