North Korea on Monday proposed resuming six-nation talks on its nuclear program during the week of September 12, a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the North's official KCNA news agency as saying. Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13-day session in Beijing. The Korean negotiations -- bringing together the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia -- are to resume near the end of this month.
