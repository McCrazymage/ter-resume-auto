Perhaps partly as a result, a startling 55 percent of Americans -- and 67 percent of those who voted for President Bush -- do not, according to a recent CBS poll, believe in evolution at all. In states as diverse as Wisconsin, South Carolina, Kansas, Montana, Arkansas and Mississippi, school boards are arguing over whether to include ``intelligent design'' in their curriculums. Also last week, a Georgia county school board voted to appeal a judge's decision to remove stickers describing evolution as a ``theory, not a fact'' from school textbooks.
