``The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), long suspected to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the' Big Woods' region of eastern Arkansas'', researchers reported in the journal Science to be published. The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. The bird was spotted near where it was last seen. Experts have rediscovered the Ivory billed woodpecker in the United States 61 years after it was put on the extinct list and the government said Thursday that 10 million dollars would be spent to make sure it stays alive.
