Gunmen stormed into the city's Chaldean and Armenian churches in the latest attacks on Iraq's minority Christian community, they said. The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the 1950s and enlarged four decades later. Iraq's Christian parties complain they lack funding and are living in danger ahead of landmark parliamentary elections scheduled for January 30. In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
