Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. Nelson said that the details of his plan remain fluid, but that it would leave the filibuster rules intact while confirming more of Bush's nominees than Reid has said his party can accept. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise.
