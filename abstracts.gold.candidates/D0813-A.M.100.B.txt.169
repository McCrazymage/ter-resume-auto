Republican Dino Rossi held a mere 261-vote lead over Democratic Attorney General Christine Gregoire after all counties reported their final tallies to the state. A recount is required by state law when there is less than a 2,000-vote margin. The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has ``never seen anything like this before.''
