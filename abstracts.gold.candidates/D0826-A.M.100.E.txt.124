To their credit, it is two independent-minded Republicans -- McCain and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado -- who have exposed the sordid tale and are trying to clean up the mess. Abramoff was called before a hearing of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee last week, where he spent the morning invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. McCain, Campbell and other senators, wielding documents obtained via Senate subpoena, charged that Abramoff and public relations executive Michael Scanlon, a former aide to DeLay, have been running a crude political extortion racket that bilked tribes out of millions of dollars.
