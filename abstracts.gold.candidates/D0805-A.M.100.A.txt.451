Medicare has a toll-free hotline and a Web site to help people sort through the new Part D drug coverage. 1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your medications handy. 4) If you pick the ``information'' option, you may find yourself in a loop of various recordings. 5) Tell the agent you want a list of stand-alone drug plans and their costs to you, based on your particular medications. Make sure the agent types in your specific medications before comparing plan costs.
