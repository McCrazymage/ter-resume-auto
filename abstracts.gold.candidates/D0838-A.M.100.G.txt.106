The most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory. Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone.
