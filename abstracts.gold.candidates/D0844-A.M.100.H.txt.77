Just Friday, columnist Charles Krauthammer and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol called on Bush to withdraw the Miers nomination, with Krauthammer deriding her selection as ``scandalous'' and ``a joke.'' The president made it clear Friday that he has no intention of backing down. Among the most outspoken detractors was former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who, on NBC television's ``Meet the Press'' program, said Bush should name someone else to fill the vacancy on the US high court.
