The offer came last week in Laos during a meeting of Asian foreign ministers, according to Radio Pyongyang, monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Paek was quoted as saying North Korea would rejoin the treaty and open up to international inspectors ``once the nuclear issue is resolved smoothly.'' North Korea on Monday proposed resuming six-nation talks on its nuclear program during the week of September 12, a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the North's official KCNA news agency as saying. Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13-day session in Beijing.
