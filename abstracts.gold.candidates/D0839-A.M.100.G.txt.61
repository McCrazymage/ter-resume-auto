Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. The evangelist said he had spoken to ``nine of Taylor's top 10 generals'' and that he feared that Taylor could have sufficient support in Liberia so that his extradition and prosecution for warcrimes could provoke violent unrest. However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his guru Paul.
