The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a bus on Thursday morning. The bus explosion was one of four co-ordinated bombings, the others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in the morning rush hour. According to The Times, a single bomb maker using military-grade explosives was most likely responsible for manufacturing all the bombs used in the attacks.
