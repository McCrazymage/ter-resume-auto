Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary election dominated by pro-presidential forces simmered for a second week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene. The police were not reported to have used excessive force. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. The parliamentary elections, which are a stepping stone to presidential elections on October 30, have been surrounded by controversy, with protests in several parts of this mountainous country in the days leading up to the vote.
