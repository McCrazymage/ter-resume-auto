Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match.
