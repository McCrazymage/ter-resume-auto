The submarine tender, which is equipped with rescue gear, left from Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo and is expected to rendezvous with the other ships at the site off Russia's Pacific coast on Monday or Tuesday, he said. Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity. The Russian submarine had been tending an underwater antenna mounted to the sea floor when it became snagged on a wire helping to stabilize a ventilation cable attached to the antenna, the official said.
