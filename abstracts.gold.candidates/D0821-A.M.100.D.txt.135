British police are on the verge of identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday. Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station. Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source.
