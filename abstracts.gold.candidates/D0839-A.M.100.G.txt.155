Taylor met Wednesday with the renowned Indian evangelist Kilari Anand Paul in the eastern city of Calabar an AFP correspondent saw -- as pressure rose on Nigeria to extradite him to face war crimes charges. However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his guru Paul. Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
