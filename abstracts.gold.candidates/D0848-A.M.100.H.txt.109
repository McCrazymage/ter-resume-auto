The court, in a ruling dated December 2, said that since the alleged offence was committed before Turkey amended its penal code earlier this year, Pamuk should be judged under the old law, which requires a direct order from the justice ministry for the trial to proceed. The European Union (EU) sent a clear warning to Turkey on Thursday over the trial of a well-known novelist, saying it would affect the Muslim country's EU accession process. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this.
