In addition, Hal Turner, a white-supremacist radio host in New Jersey who said in 2003 that it would be illegal but not wrong to kill Lefkow said Wednesday that federal agents had also questioned him about his whereabouts during the Monday killings. The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two white men they want to question in connection with this week's execution-style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband, in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives, friends and sympathizers of a white-supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the judge's assassination.
