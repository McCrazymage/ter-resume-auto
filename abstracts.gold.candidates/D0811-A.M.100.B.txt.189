The body is ``the 10th planet of the solar system,'' said Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech in the town of Pasadena. But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of ``planet'' and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. A US astronomer announced Friday he had discovered what could be a 10th planet in the outer reaches of the solar system nearly 15 billion kilometers (nine billion miles) from earth. The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet's mass.
