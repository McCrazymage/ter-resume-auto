Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. The prime minister called on the Sudanese government to commit to the humanitarian protocol it reached with the Darfur rebels in Nigerian capital of Abuja in September and to help humanitarian aid reach affected people of Darfur. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said.
