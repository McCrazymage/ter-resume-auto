Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Both parties' leaderships are wary of a bipartisan bid by a few centrists to find a middle ground that would force GOP and Democratic leaders to accept options they have called intolerable. Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise. But both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue -- often called ``the nuclear option'' -- as early as next week, if not Friday.
