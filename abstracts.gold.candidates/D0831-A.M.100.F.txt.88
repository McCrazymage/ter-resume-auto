Despite mistrust on both sides, Restrepo said the government is willing to release the 15 jailed rebels first, provided the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, at least expresses a willingness to reciprocate. Before any face-to-face meeting can take place, however, the rebels must agree to swap 15 hostages for 15 rebels jailed on minor charges, said Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo. ``This proposal addresses the need to find a solution at a time when we are all concerned about being on a street with no exits,'' said Castro.
