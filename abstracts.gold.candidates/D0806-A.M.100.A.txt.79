The White House announced Saturday night that President Bush would fly to Washington from his Texas ranch Sunday to sign the emergency legislation. The announcement came in dramatic fashion, trumpeted by conservative Republican leaders who persuaded Democrats to agree to the measure as long as it pertained only to the 41-year-old Florida woman and did not open the way for moving other such emotionally charged cases into the federal courts. Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life.
