The townspeople complain that convoys of trucks carrying material for the project have wrecked roads in the area and are demanding compensation, the Imedi television station said. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
