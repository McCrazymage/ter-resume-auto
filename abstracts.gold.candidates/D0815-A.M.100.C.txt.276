Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. But Republicans said Democrats have a history of labeling mainstream conservatives as extremists. Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise. But both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue -- often called ``the nuclear option'' -- as early as next week, if not Friday.
