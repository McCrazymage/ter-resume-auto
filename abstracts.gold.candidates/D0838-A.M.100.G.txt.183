It is also the first to definitively conclude outside of a laboratory setting that holding a phone to your ear and talking through a hands-free device poses the same risks. The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands-free devices. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands-free device in the car and how often the device was used.
