A recount is required by state law when there is less than a 2,000-vote margin. ``We really aren't going to know before we do this recount who the governor is going to be,'' said Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who will oversee the recount process. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has ``never seen anything like this before.''
