Demonstrators in the southwest of the Caucasus republic of Georgia staged protests Friday against the building of an oil pipeline through their district, a local television station reported. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline.
