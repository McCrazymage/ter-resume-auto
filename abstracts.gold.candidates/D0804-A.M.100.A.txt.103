Molly was stranded in the floodwaters that submerged New Orleans East. Out of at least 3,000 cats and dogs and several hundred birds, reptiles and other exotic pets recovered so far, only 300 to 400 have been reunited with their owners since the storm, she said. Within 24 hours dog and owner were reunited in Lake Charles, La.
