In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time.
