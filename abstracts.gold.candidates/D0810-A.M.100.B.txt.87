On Capitol Hill, lawmakers vowed to swiftly overhaul the oversight of the federally chartered company. The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Raines after the announcement by the SEC's top accountant that the company had violated two rules. But people involved in the inquiry said that board members know that they can not let the uncertainty hanging over Raines linger, both for the sake of the company and the markets, and predicted that a decision would be made soon.
