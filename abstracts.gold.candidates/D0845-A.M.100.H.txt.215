``The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), long suspected to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the' Big Woods' region of eastern Arkansas'', researchers reported in the journal Science to be published. The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. The bird was spotted near where it was last seen. ``This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation,'' he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
