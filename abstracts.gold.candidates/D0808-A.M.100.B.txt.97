Gunmen stormed into the city's Chaldean and Armenian churches in the latest attacks on Iraq's minority Christian community, they said. The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the 1950s and enlarged four decades later. ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church.
