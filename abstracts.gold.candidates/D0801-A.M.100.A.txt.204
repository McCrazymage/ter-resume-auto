With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. ``The takeoff went perfectly,'' Alain Garcia, an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in Paris.
