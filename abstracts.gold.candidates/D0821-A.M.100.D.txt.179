The bus explosion was one of four co-ordinated bombings, the others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in the morning rush hour. Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station. Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source. ``The nature of the explosives appears to be military, which is very worrying,'' Superintendent Christophe Chaboud, head of France's anti-terrorism police, who is helping the London inquiry, was quoted as saying.
