The authorities would not say where or when the two men, one in his mid-20s and the other aged 50 to 60, were seen or whether they were suspects or witnesses. The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two white men they want to question in connection with this week's execution-style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband, in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives, friends and sympathizers of a white-supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the judge's assassination. ``They know where I was and I 've been cleared,'' David Hale said Wednesday.
