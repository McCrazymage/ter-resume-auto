But when rescue workers airlifted the owner last week, Molly, a black Labrador seeing-eye dog, was left behind. Five days passed, said Laura Maloney, director of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before the New Orleans police, National Guard soldiers and a man named Joe with a boat found their way to the house. The society is keeping an average of about 2,000 animals at the Lamar-Dixon Center in Gonzalez, La., flying or driving about 500 to Houston and other places every other day.
