Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
