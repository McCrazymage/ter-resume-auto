With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the ``total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380.'' The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes, but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
