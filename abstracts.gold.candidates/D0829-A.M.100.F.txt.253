Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday. ``Bullock contacted the Red Cross last week to make this, her second million dollar gift, to the American Red Cross,'' added the statement. ``Sandra continues to enable our lifesaving work and is a model for personal generosity,'' said Marsha J. Evans, the American Red Cross president. Canadian record label Nettwerk Management has enlisted some of its big guns to perform in benefit concerts at the end of the month.
