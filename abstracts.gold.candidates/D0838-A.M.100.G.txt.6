A study of Australian drivers found that those using cell phones were four times as likely to be involved in a serious crash regardless of whether they used hands-free devices like earpieces or speaker phones that have been perceived as making talking while driving safer. The study, which is to appear in The British Medical Journal on Tuesday, is the first of its kind to use actual crash data and cell phone records to show a link between talking on the phone and being seriously injured in an accident.
