The most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. The study, which is to appear in The British Medical Journal on Tuesday, is the first of its kind to use actual crash data and cell phone records to show a link between talking on the phone and being seriously injured in an accident.
