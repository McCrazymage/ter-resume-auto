So the news that the magnificent bird has been found in an Arkansas swamp -- six decades after it was thought to be extinct in the United States -- hit the Nature Conservancy ecologist like a thunderclap. Experts have rediscovered the Ivory billed woodpecker in the United States 61 years after it was put on the extinct list and the government said Thursday that 10 million dollars would be spent to make sure it stays alive.
