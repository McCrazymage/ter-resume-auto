Outside the nursing facility in Florida where Schiavo is being cared for, her mother had pleaded earlier Saturday for lawmakers and the president to intervene.

Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing about.''
