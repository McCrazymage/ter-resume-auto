The most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
