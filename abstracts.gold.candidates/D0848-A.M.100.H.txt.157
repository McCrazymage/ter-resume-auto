Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday. The European Union (EU) sent a clear warning to Turkey on Thursday over the trial of a well-known novelist, saying it would affect the Muslim country's EU accession process. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this.
