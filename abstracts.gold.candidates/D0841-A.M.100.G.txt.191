The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans. Spain ``is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle against centuries of discrimination,'' de la Vega said. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual.
