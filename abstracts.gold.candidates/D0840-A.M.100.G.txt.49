In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin, Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The workers also gaze at something more familiar : two monitors displaying The Weather Channel. It's ready to meet the demands of 20 million Texans; ready to deal with another peak day like that of Aug. 7, 2003, when the state's electrical usage reached a record 60,095 megawatts.
