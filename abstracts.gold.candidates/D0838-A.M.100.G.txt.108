The most up-to-date research by the federal government has relied either on volunteers who were videotaped during a crash or on experiments in which a driver was monitored by researchers in a laboratory. Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
