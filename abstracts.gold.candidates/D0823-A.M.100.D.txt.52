Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising the case said Wednesday. Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the former head of the KGB -- the Soviet agency which used drugs against political foes and foreign spies. Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no idea as to what caused them.
