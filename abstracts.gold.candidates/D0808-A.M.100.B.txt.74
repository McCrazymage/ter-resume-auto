Two churches in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul came under simultaneous attack on Tuesday, witnesses and clerics said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. The Chaldeans, whose 600,000 people represent the majority of Christians in Iraq, are an oriental rite Catholic community. In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
