Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary election dominated by pro-presidential forces simmered for a second week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene. The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the government and the presidency. Voting equipment being used such as indelible ink for marking voters' fingers to ensure they vote only once and transparent ballot boxes ``are all recognised as ensuring fair and honest elections,'' the Kyrgyz leader said after casting his vote in the capital Bishkek.
