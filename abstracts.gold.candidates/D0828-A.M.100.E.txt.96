( c) 2004, Newsday= NEW YORK -- Martha Stewart says she has been deluged by ``thousands'' of letters from fans sent to her federal prison camp in Alderson, W.V., some of which have even included gifts and money. In a posting on her Web site, marthatalks.com, Stewart instead urged fans to make a donation to the American Cancer Society instead. However Zobel said inmate mail is subject to inspection for contraband or other banned items before it leaves the prison's postal facility.
