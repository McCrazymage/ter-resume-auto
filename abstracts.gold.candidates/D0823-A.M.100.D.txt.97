Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the former head of the KGB -- the Soviet agency which used drugs against political foes and foreign spies. His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich. ``They are examining blood and other samples. They are still considering the theory of poisoning, but also finding difficulty in proving it,'' he said, declining to name the US hospital as he had not asked their permission.
