Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' But Republicans said Democrats have a history of labeling mainstream conservatives as extremists. Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise.
