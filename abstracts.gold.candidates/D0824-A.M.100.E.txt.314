Analyzing cells from milk ducts doesn't reliably detect breast cancer, U.S. researchers reported Tuesday _ dashing hopes that the experimental technique could diagnose high-risk women sooner. Mammograms work very well at detecting early breast cancer, but they 're not perfect. The milk duct technique, called ductal lavage, is among those experimental alternatives. ``Ductal lavage should not be recommended to high-risk women as a technique to detect cancer earlier than imaging modalities'' she concluded. The test uncovered clear cancer signs in just 13 percent of the cancerous breasts tested, and possible signs in 42 percent.
