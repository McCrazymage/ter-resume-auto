Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources. Official statistics said that from January to September this year, 4,228 people were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
