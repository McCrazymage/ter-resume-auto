The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has short-listed experiments from five nations including the United States, Britain and Germany, for a slot on India's unmanned moon mission Chandrayaan-1 to be undertaken by 2006-2007, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday. After the recent visits of Afghan President Hamid Karzai to Delhi and Indian foreign minister K. Natwar Singh to Kabul last month, the Afghan health ministry decided to upgrade IGICH with a polyclinic, a diagnostic center and a surgical block, IGICH director Abdul Salam Jalali told media.
