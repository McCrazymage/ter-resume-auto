The stage begins when the bamboo forms flowers, after which the pandas refuse to eat it. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of the 220,000-hectare (544,000-acre) preserve, Xinhua said. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
