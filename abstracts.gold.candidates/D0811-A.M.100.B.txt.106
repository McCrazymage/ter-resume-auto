If confirmed, the discovery by Professor Mike Brown of the respected California Institute of Technology would be the first of a planet since Pluto was identified in 1930. Because it was moving, astronomers ruled it was a moon and not a background star, which is stationary. The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet's mass.
