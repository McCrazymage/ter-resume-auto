If confirmed, the discovery by Professor Mike Brown of the respected California Institute of Technology would be the first of a planet since Pluto was identified in 1930. The planet is a typical member of the Kuiper belt, but its sheer size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be classified as a planet, Brown said. While observing the new, so-called planet from Hawaii last month, a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it.
