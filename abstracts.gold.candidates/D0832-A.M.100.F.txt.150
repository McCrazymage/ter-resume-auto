The contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for $ 1,675,000. When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother to put it on the market. Cunningham, meanwhile, upgraded to a $2.55 million house, with 7 1/2 baths and a five-car garage. MZM, one of Cunningham's top campaign donors, obtained millions in government contracts; the congressman, who also sits on the House intelligence committee, acknowledged to Stern that he had helped MZM win contracts, as he said he has helped other firms.
