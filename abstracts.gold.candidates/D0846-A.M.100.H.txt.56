Some 800,000 people were gathering Thursday in a vast field on the edge of the southern Polish city of Krakow for a mass in memory of Pope John Paul II, a police spokeswoman said. ``We estimate there are almost 800,000 faithful at the moment, but people continue to fill up the Blonia esplanadae,'' said police spokeswoman Sylwia Bober. ``He left something very special for me, as a sign of his gratitude, but I'm not prepared to say what it is,'' he said, adding that Dziwisz had given it to him on his arrival in Rome on Sunday.
