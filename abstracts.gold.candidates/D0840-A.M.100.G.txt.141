ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas. It's ready to meet the demands of 20 million Texans; ready to deal with another peak day like that of Aug. 7, 2003, when the state's electrical usage reached a record 60,095 megawatts. Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the state because the system isn't connected to other major grids in North America.
