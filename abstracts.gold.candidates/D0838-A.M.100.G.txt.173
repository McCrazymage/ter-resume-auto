Because cell phone records are not considered public information, a similar study has not been conducted in the United States. Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands-free device in the car and how often the device was used.
