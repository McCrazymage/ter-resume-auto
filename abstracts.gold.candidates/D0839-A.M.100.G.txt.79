Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. Obasanjo invited Taylor to Nigeria in order to bring an end to a 14-year-civil war which pitched the guerrilla chief turned elected ruler against two powerful rebel groups. Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
