A recount is required by state law when there is less than a 2,000-vote margin. The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast. ``It's fun, it's exciting, it's like a two-week playoff series. But it's a lot more important than a ballgame,'' said Joe Arko, a Texas doctor who has been following the Washington election religiously on the Internet.
