Because cell phone records are not considered public information, a similar study has not been conducted in the United States. It is also the first to definitively conclude outside of a laboratory setting that holding a phone to your ear and talking through a hands-free device poses the same risks. They then examined similar time intervals in the days before the crash to calculate the increased risk of using the cellphone. Rather, they asked drivers how often they used such a device and factored that into determining the devices' effectiveness.
