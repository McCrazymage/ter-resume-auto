President Bush Friday rejected conservative calls to withdraw his nomination of White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and prepared to reassure skeptical Republicans and persuade the Senate to confirm her for the seat of retiring Justice Sandra Day O 'Connor. Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.'' ``He has put up an unknown and undistinguished figure for an opening that conservatives worked for a generation to see filled with a jurist of high distinction,'' the magazine's editor Bill Kristol wrote.
