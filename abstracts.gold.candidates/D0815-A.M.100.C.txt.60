Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., meanwhile, has said the right to filibuster must remain intact and President Bush must withdraw three of his most contentious appellate court nominees. Nelson said that the details of his plan remain fluid, but that it would leave the filibuster rules intact while confirming more of Bush's nominees than Reid has said his party can accept.
