In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year. The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
