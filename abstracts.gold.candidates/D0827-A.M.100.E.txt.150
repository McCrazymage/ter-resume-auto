The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani decided on Saturday to contribute 100 million US dollars to the victims of the Katrina hurricane in the United States. The Qatar News Agency quoted a source at the Foreign Ministry as saying that the donation was made in the name of the government and people of Qatar. Hurricane Katrina caused a first fatality in southeastern Florida Thursday when it sent a tree crashing on the roof of a car in Fort Lauderdale, local television reported.
