Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying-off stage. Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of the 220,000-hectare (544,000-acre) preserve, Xinhua said. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
