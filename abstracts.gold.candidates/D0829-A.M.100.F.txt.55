The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement. ``Bullock contacted the Red Cross last week to make this, her second million dollar gift, to the American Red Cross,'' added the statement. The star of ``Speed'' and ``While You Were Sleeping'' also gave one million dollars after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.
