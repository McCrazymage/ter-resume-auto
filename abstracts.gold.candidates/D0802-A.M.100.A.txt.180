Leaders of the Arctic region's indigenous people on Friday urged European countries to step up the fight against global warming, saying it is threatening their societies, economies and cultures. ``There is some tough sledding ahead to make the rest of the cuts in greenhouse gases that will be needed,'' said Chief Gary Harrison, a council member, at a meeting in Copenhagen. There are fears that polar bears and some seal species could face extinction in just decades because of global warming. The council believes temperatures in the Arctic will increase 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2080.
