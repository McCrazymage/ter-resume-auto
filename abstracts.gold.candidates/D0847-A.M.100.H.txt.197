Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the government and the presidency. Opposition supporters in Kyrgyzstan have held protests for more than a week since a March 13 run-off election that saw the opposition presence in the 75-member parliament reduced to a mere handful of seats.
