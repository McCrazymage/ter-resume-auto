Republican Dino Rossi held a mere 261-vote lead over Democratic Attorney General Christine Gregoire after all counties reported their final tallies to the state. A recount is required by state law when there is less than a 2,000-vote margin. ``After this election, I'm going to have' Every vote counts' tattooed on my forehead,'' Gregoire spokesman Morton Brilliant said Wednesday. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has ``never seen anything like this before.''
