The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
