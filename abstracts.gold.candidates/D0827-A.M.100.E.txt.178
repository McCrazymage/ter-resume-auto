``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Katrina will have ``a profound impact on (insurance) market conditions'', Douetil added. Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars. The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani decided on Saturday to contribute 100 million US dollars to the victims of the Katrina hurricane in the United States.
