From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. Commissioner Bud Selig and Major League Baseball have taken a lot of heat over the last several months for their supposed failure to grapple forthrightly with the sport's steroid problem. The prevailing view was that top offensive performances in baseball demanded quick reflexes, good eye-hand coordination, quick feet, flexibility and strong wrists -- not bulky muscles. They would benefit from taking a step back and looking more carefully at the evolution of the steroid problem in baseball. At the time, many anabolic steroids were illegal if purchased without a prescription.
