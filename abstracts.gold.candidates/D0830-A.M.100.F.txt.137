The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
