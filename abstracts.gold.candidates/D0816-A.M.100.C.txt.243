Similar remarks were made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il last month during a meeting with a South Korean envoy. North Korea declared on February 10 it possessed nuclear weapons and said it needed them as a deterrent to what it said were US plans to launch a nuclear attack against it. That they lasted so long is encouraging : Three previous rounds ended after only three days. The Korean negotiations -- bringing together the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia -- are to resume near the end of this month.
