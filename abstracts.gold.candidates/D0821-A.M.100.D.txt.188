``I think we are going to see photographs of one or more suspects being posted within days,'' the official told the paper. Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station.

Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source.
