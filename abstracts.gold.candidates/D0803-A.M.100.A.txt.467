Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. Official statistics said that from January to September this year, 4,228 people were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
