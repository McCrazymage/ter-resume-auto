Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike on Thursday demanded that senior executives, including the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, return tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation that they had earned based on inaccurate financial statements that the company issued from 2001 until this year. Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations.
