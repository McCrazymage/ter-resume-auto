Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary election dominated by pro-presidential forces simmered for a second week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene. The police were not reported to have used excessive force. Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. Opposition supporters in Kyrgyzstan have held protests for more than a week since a March 13 run-off election that saw the opposition presence in the 75-member parliament reduced to a mere handful of seats.
