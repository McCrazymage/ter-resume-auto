Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. The court, in a ruling dated December 2, said that since the alleged offence was committed before Turkey amended its penal code earlier this year, Pamuk should be judged under the old law, which requires a direct order from the justice ministry for the trial to proceed. Orhan Pamuk, who has won a number of international awards in literature, will go on trial in Istanbul on Friday for ``insulting'' Turkey.
