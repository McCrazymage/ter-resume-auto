The body is ``the 10th planet of the solar system,'' said Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech in the town of Pasadena. ``It's definitely bigger than Pluto,'' he said of the body made up of ice and rock. The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet's mass. While observing the new, so-called planet from Hawaii last month, a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it.
