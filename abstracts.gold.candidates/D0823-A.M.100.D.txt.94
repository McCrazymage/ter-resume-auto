West-leaning Yushchenko, who Wednesday called for a fresh vote as official results showed Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich had defeated him in Sunday's presidential election, was admitted to the private Austrian hospital in September suffering from a severe gastro-intestinal illness. Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no idea as to what caused them. Zimpfer said the hospital had found no evidence of poisoning and neither had a medical insitute in the United States to which they referred the case within days.
