The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a bus on Thursday morning. British police are on the verge of identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday. ``There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top of it,'' a ``senior police source'' told the paper.
