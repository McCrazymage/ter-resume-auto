Evelyn Hutcheson and David Hale, the mother and brother of Matthew Hale, the man convicted last year of plotting the murder of the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow, said Wednesday that federal agents had asked them whether Hale might have communicated something from prison in code. ``They know where I was and I 've been cleared,'' David Hale said Wednesday. According to a report in Wednesday's issue of The Chicago Sun-Times, the authorities are also pursuing telephone calls made to Lefkow's home Sunday night from a correctional facility.
