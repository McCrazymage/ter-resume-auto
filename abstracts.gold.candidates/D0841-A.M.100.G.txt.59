The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. ``It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life,'' insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference. But according to an opinion poll conducted in late July, some two-thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and now the cabinet has approved the bill such liaisons could become legal from as early as next year.
