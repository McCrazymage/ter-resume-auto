The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. The first sighting of the spectacular bird is reported to be on Feb. 11, 2004, and has been followed by several others, including one on April 25, 2004, in which the bird was videotaped. Experts have rediscovered the Ivory billed woodpecker in the United States 61 years after it was put on the extinct list and the government said Thursday that 10 million dollars would be spent to make sure it stays alive.
