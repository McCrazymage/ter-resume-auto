Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations. But people involved in the inquiry said that board members know that they can not let the uncertainty hanging over Raines linger, both for the sake of the company and the markets, and predicted that a decision would be made soon. The company declined to comment further about the findings of the SEC staff or the remarks of lawmakers.
