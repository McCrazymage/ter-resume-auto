L 'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined ``Armstrong's Lie'' suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999. The sports daily based its accusation on tests carried out by a French laboratory on frozen urine samples taken during the race six years ago. The exploits of seven-times Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong, who is alleged to have used the banned blood booster EPO (erythropoietin) in 1999, are also down to the use of other banned substances according to one expert.
