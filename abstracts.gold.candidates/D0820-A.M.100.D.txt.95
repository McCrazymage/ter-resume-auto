The submarine tender, which is equipped with rescue gear, left from Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo and is expected to rendezvous with the other ships at the site off Russia's Pacific coast on Monday or Tuesday, he said. Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the U.S. Navy has also been asked for assistance, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported. At Moscow's request, Japan has dispatched four naval vessels to help rescue a Russian submarine snagged on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, but the ships aren't expected to arrive at the scene until early next week.
