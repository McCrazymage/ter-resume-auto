If you want Medicare to help you compare drug plans, here are a few suggestions. 1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your medications handy. The fastest way to talk to a live person is to select ``enrollment.'' 3) After listing some pertinent dates, you will be asked to select either ``enrollment'' ``information'' or ``publication.'' Make sure the agent types in your specific medications before comparing plan costs.
