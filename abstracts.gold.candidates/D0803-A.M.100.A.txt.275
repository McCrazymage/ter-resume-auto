In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. Violation of safety rules was attributed to Sunday's deadly colliery gas blast that killed 16 persons in Taiyuan of Shanxi Province, investigators said here Tuesday.
