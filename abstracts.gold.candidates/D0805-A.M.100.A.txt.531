If you want Medicare to help you compare drug plans, here are a few suggestions. The fastest way to talk to a live person is to select ``enrollment.'' 4) If you pick the ``information'' option, you may find yourself in a loop of various recordings. 5) Tell the agent you want a list of stand-alone drug plans and their costs to you, based on your particular medications. Make sure the agent types in your specific medications before comparing plan costs.
