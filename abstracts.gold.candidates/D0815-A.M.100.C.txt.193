Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., meanwhile, has said the right to filibuster must remain intact and President Bush must withdraw three of his most contentious appellate court nominees. But Republicans said Democrats have a history of labeling mainstream conservatives as extremists. Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise.
