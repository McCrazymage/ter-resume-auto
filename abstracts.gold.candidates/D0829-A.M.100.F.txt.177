The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement. Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday. ``Sandra continues to enable our lifesaving work and is a model for personal generosity,'' said Marsha J. Evans, the American Red Cross president. Canadian Television will broadcast January 29 concert live from Vancouver.
