Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy held a crisis meeting Friday on running riots that have plunged France into its worst explosion of urban violence in decades. She was allegedly doused with petrol by one youth, then others threw a flaming rag on her. According to prosecutors Friday, a 56-year-old woman was unable to get off a bus targeted by a Molotov cocktail late Wednesday in the northern Paris suburb of Sevran.
