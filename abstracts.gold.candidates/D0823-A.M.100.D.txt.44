Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising the case said Wednesday. ``There was no underlying illness of the liver or pancreas that suddenly broke out,'' he said. His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich.
