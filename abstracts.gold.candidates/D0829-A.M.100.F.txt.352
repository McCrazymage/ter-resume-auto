``Sandra continues to enable our lifesaving work and is a model for personal generosity,'' said Marsha J. Evans, the American Red Cross president. The star of ``Speed'' and ``While You Were Sleeping'' also gave one million dollars after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Plans are in the works for several big concerts, with the proceeds going to various charities involved in the tsunami relief effort. Canadian Television will broadcast January 29 concert live from Vancouver.
