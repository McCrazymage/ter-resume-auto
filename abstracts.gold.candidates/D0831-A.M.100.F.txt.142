``All we 're looking for is a minimum sign of hope and we will start the ball rolling,'' Restrepo told local radio. The proposal calls for a total of 50 jailed rebels to be freed in return for about 60 so-called political prisoners the FARC is holding in jungle hideouts. The FARC's hostages include politicians, police officers, soldiers and three U.S. contractors whose small plane crashed in rebel-held territory early last year. ``This proposal addresses the need to find a solution at a time when we are all concerned about being on a street with no exits,'' said Castro.
