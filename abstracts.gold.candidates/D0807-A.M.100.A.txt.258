Cheney told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, information that Libby understood came from the agency, the indictment said. Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting ``that such information was not widely known,'' the indictment said. Names of two of the others were disclosed by a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the identities have not been publicly released. This person, identified as ``Official A,'' also spoke about Plame's job and identity with columnist Robert Novak a few days before Novak's column appeared.
