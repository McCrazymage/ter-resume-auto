``The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), long suspected to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the' Big Woods' region of eastern Arkansas'', researchers reported in the journal Science to be published. The first sighting of the spectacular bird is reported to be on Feb. 11, 2004, and has been followed by several others, including one on April 25, 2004, in which the bird was videotaped. Twenty years ago, Chris Pague picked up a stuffed specimen of an ivory-billed woodpecker and marveled at what had been lost.
