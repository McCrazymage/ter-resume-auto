Paul told journalists after meeting Taylor : ``He said' there will be tremendous destabilisation in Liberia if the extradition takes place '.'' The evangelist said he had spoken to ``nine of Taylor's top 10 generals'' and that he feared that Taylor could have sufficient support in Liberia so that his extradition and prosecution for warcrimes could provoke violent unrest. Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media.
