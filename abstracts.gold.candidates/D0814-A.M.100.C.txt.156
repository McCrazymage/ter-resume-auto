Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. He added that he would hold a meeting in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with Nigerian president and current AU Chairman Olusegun Obasanjo to map out an urgent plan to send more African troups to Darfur. Khartoum must take serious steps to implement the United Nations resolutions on Darfur and specify the areas for its army and the militias in the region, said Blair. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said.
