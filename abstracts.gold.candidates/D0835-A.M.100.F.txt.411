From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. Before the mid-1990s, the substances of choice in the clubhouse were amphetamines and recreational drugs. The prevailing view was that top offensive performances in baseball demanded quick reflexes, good eye-hand coordination, quick feet, flexibility and strong wrists -- not bulky muscles. At the time, many anabolic steroids were illegal if purchased without a prescription. But as baseball became more aware of this as a growing issue, the commissioner's office did, in fact, act.
