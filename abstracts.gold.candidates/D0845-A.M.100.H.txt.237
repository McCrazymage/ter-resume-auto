The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. The bird was spotted near where it was last seen. Twenty years ago, Chris Pague picked up a stuffed specimen of an ivory-billed woodpecker and marveled at what had been lost. So the news that the magnificent bird has been found in an Arkansas swamp -- six decades after it was thought to be extinct in the United States -- hit the Nature Conservancy ecologist like a thunderclap.
