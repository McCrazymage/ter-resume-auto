Some 300 supporters of a candidate who lost his bid for a parliament seat to the daughter of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev gathered in central Bishkek, in the words of one, to ``hold a peaceful meeting to defend freedom of speech and honest elections.'' Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the government and the presidency.
