Some 300 supporters of a candidate who lost his bid for a parliament seat to the daughter of Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev gathered in central Bishkek, in the words of one, to ``hold a peaceful meeting to defend freedom of speech and honest elections.'' Voting equipment being used such as indelible ink for marking voters' fingers to ensure they vote only once and transparent ballot boxes ``are all recognised as ensuring fair and honest elections,'' the Kyrgyz leader said after casting his vote in the capital Bishkek.
