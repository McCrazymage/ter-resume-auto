Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life. Outside the nursing facility in Florida where Schiavo is being cared for, her mother had pleaded earlier Saturday for lawmakers and the president to intervene. ``Please, please, please save my little girl,'' said Mary Schindler. Terri Schiavo's case has become a cause celebre for evangelical Christians, who have opposed efforts by her husband to end the medical measures that have kept her alive for the past 15 years.
