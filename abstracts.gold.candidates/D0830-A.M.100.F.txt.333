The investigation was reopened in March 2004 after the killer, who had remained silent for decades, wrote to a local television station. Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
