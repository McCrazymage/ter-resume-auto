Blair told reporters that the African monitoring forces must be expanded by sending thousands of troops to ensure ceasefire agreement and access of true information on the situation in Darfur. The prime minister called on the Sudanese government to commit to the humanitarian protocol it reached with the Darfur rebels in Nigerian capital of Abuja in September and to help humanitarian aid reach affected people of Darfur. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said.
