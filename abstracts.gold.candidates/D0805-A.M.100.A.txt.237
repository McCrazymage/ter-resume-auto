Medicare has a toll-free hotline and a Web site to help people sort through the new Part D drug coverage. The fastest way to talk to a live person is to select ``enrollment.'' When you are ready to talk to a live person, either return to the main menu and start over, or select the ``status'' option and follow that with the ``agent'' option. Make sure the agent types in your specific medications before comparing plan costs.
