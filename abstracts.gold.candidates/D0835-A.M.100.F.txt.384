Some have even suggested that people in the commissioner's office have been winking at one another while they make public pronouncements against steroid use. From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. They would benefit from taking a step back and looking more carefully at the evolution of the steroid problem in baseball. But as baseball became more aware of this as a growing issue, the commissioner's office did, in fact, act. Indeed, it was probably around 10 years ago that some people in baseball became aware that anabolic steroids were being used by some players.
