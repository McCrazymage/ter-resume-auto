The contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for $ 1,675,000. When Cunningham wanted to sell his house in 2003, he didn't bother to put it on the market. Cunningham, meanwhile, upgraded to a $2.55 million house, with 7 1/2 baths and a five-car garage. Government contracts for the company, whose Web site describes it as helping solve ``enigmatic problems ... in the areas of intelligence collection and analysis,'' grew from $41 million in 2003 to $66 million in 2004, according to Washington Technology magazine. Cunningham said in a statement that he didn't do anything wrong.
