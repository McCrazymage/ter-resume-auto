North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13-day session in Beijing. That they lasted so long is encouraging : Three previous rounds ended after only three days. The Korean negotiations -- bringing together the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia -- are to resume near the end of this month.
