Some 800,000 people were gathering Thursday in a vast field on the edge of the southern Polish city of Krakow for a mass in memory of Pope John Paul II, a police spokeswoman said. ``We estimate there are almost 800,000 faithful at the moment, but people continue to fill up the Blonia esplanadae,'' said police spokeswoman Sylwia Bober. Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to ``be himself.'' The next pope should not try to be another John Paul II, the Polish-born pope's first private secretary, Irish Bishop John Magee, said Thursday.
