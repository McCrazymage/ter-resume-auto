Russian navy officials said the mini-submarine, trapped at a depth of 190 meters (625 feet), had seven sailors aboard, and it was unclear how long their oxygen supply would last. The Russian submarine had been tending an underwater antenna mounted to the sea floor when it became snagged on a wire helping to stabilize a ventilation cable attached to the antenna, the official said. All seven crew members were alive and rushed aboard a Russian surface vessel, where they were being examined by a medical team, Russian news agencies and the U.S. Navy said.
