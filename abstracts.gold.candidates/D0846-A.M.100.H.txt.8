Some 800,000 people were gathering Thursday in a vast field on the edge of the southern Polish city of Krakow for a mass in memory of Pope John Paul II, a police spokeswoman said. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
