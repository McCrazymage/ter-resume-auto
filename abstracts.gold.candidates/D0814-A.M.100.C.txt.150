Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. Blair told reporters that the African monitoring forces must be expanded by sending thousands of troops to ensure ceasefire agreement and access of true information on the situation in Darfur. The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he said. Blair described his talks with Sudanese officials as constructive, urging the conflicting sides in Darfur to fulfill their commitments within a week or a month.
