``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Hurricane Katrina could leave the world's insurers facing a bill of up to 50 billion dollars (40 billion euros), British company Brit Insurance forecast on Tuesday. Katrina will have ``a profound impact on (insurance) market conditions'', Douetil added. Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars.
