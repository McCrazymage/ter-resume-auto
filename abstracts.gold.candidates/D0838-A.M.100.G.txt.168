Because cell phone records are not considered public information, a similar study has not been conducted in the United States. The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands-free devices. Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. The researchers asked several questions, including whether the driver had a hands-free device in the car and how often the device was used.
