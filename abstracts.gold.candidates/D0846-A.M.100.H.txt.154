Some 800,000 people were gathering Thursday in a vast field on the edge of the southern Polish city of Krakow for a mass in memory of Pope John Paul II, a police spokeswoman said. Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to ``be himself.'' ``I think it would be very wrong if a new pope would try to emulate what John Paul II had,'' he said. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
