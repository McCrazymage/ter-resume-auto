The European Union (EU) sent a clear warning to Turkey on Thursday over the trial of a well-known novelist, saying it would affect the Muslim country's EU accession process. ``The trial of a novelist who expressed a non-violent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU,'' EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement. Rehn said Turkey should make serious efforts in bringing its legislation in line with EU laws, including the European Convention of Human Rights.
