Kyrgyz police dispersed an opposition rally in the capital Wednesday as unrest over a parliamentary election dominated by pro-presidential forces simmered for a second week, according to an AFP reporter on the scene. Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev insisted that voting in crucial parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic on Sunday was being conducted fairly, but a leading opposition figure cried foul.
