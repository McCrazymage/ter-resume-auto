The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a bus on Thursday morning. The bus explosion was one of four co-ordinated bombings, the others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in the morning rush hour. Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station.
