Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. Paul told journalists after meeting Taylor : ``He said' there will be tremendous destabilisation in Liberia if the extradition takes place '.'' ``There is no question in my mind that there will be chaos,'' added Paul. Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media.
