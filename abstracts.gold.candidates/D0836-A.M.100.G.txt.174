Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the preserve's director. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. It said 22 pandas living in the preserve's Bikou and Rangshuihe areas were directly threatened with starvation.
