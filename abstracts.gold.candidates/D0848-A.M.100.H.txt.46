Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. The 53-year-old author, wearing a dark business suit and tie, made his way into the cramped courtroom amid a crowd of reporters, supporters and protestors. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday.
