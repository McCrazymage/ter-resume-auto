The White House announced Saturday night that President Bush would fly to Washington from his Texas ranch Sunday to sign the emergency legislation. Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life. A vigil was kept at the facility in Pinellas Park; three people were arrested when they tried to enter the hospice.
