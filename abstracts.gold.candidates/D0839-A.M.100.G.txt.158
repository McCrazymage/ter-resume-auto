Taylor met Wednesday with the renowned Indian evangelist Kilari Anand Paul in the eastern city of Calabar an AFP correspondent saw -- as pressure rose on Nigeria to extradite him to face war crimes charges. Obasanjo invited Taylor to Nigeria in order to bring an end to a 14-year-civil war which pitched the guerrilla chief turned elected ruler against two powerful rebel groups. Since 2003, when an advancing rebel army forced him to flee Monrovia, Taylor has lived as a guest of Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar.
