Two churches in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul came under simultaneous attack on Tuesday, witnesses and clerics said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church. In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
