The body is ``the 10th planet of the solar system,'' said Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech in the town of Pasadena. ``It's definitely bigger than Pluto,'' he said of the body made up of ice and rock. But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of ``planet'' and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. The moon discovery is important because it can help scientists determine the new planet's mass.
