The bird was spotted near where it was last seen. The black-and- white bird, with a nearly one-meter wingspan and its distinctive ivory-colored bill, is larger than the more common pileated woodpecker that is similar in appearance. So the news that the magnificent bird has been found in an Arkansas swamp -- six decades after it was thought to be extinct in the United States -- hit the Nature Conservancy ecologist like a thunderclap. ``This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation,'' he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
