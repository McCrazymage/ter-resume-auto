North Korea declared on February 10 it possessed nuclear weapons and said it needed them as a deterrent to what it said were US plans to launch a nuclear attack against it. North Korea on Monday proposed resuming six-nation talks on its nuclear program during the week of September 12, a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the North's official KCNA news agency as saying. Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13-day session in Beijing. That they lasted so long is encouraging : Three previous rounds ended after only three days.
