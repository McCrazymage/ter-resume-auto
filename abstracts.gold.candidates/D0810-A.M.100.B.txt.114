The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Raines after the announcement by the SEC's top accountant that the company had violated two rules. That decision will now force the company to restate its earnings and take steps to significantly raise its capital level. But people involved in the inquiry said that board members know that they can not let the uncertainty hanging over Raines linger, both for the sake of the company and the markets, and predicted that a decision would be made soon.
