British police are on the verge of identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday. ``There are two bodies which have to be examined in great detail because they appear to have been holding the bomb or sitting on top of it,'' a ``senior police source'' told the paper. Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station.
