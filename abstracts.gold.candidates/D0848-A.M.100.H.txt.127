Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday. The charges stem from his remarks in an interview with a Swiss newspaper in which he said ``30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in Turkey'' during World War I and in the 1980s and 1990s. Rehn said Turkey should make serious efforts in bringing its legislation in line with EU laws, including the European Convention of Human Rights.
