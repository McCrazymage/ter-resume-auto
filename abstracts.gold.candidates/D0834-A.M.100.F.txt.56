The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post : With their slick Web sites, pseudo-academic conferences and savvy public relations, the proponents of ``intelligent design'' -- a ``theory'' that challenges the validity of Darwinian evolution -- are far more sophisticated than the creationists of yore. Nevertheless, this new generation of anti-evolutionists, arguing that children have a ``right to question'' scientific truths, has had widespread success in undermining evolutionary theory. Also last week, a Georgia county school board voted to appeal a judge's decision to remove stickers describing evolution as a ``theory, not a fact'' from school textbooks.
