The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric-ton giant aloft at about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport here. The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. In a statement released by his office soon after the airliner landed, Chirac said ``a new page of aeronautical history has been written.It is a magnificent result for European industrial cooperation and an encouragement to pursue this path of building a Europe of innovation and progress.''
