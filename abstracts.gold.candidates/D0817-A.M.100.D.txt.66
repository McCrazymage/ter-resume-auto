L 'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined ``Armstrong's Lie'' suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999. Ayotte though was quick not to cast doubts on the testing procedures of the French laboratory cited in the L 'Equipe report. Ayotte suggested this hadn't been the case with the findings used by L 'Equipe to back up their story.
