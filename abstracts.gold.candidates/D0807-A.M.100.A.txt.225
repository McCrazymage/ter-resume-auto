In no case other than Libby's does the indictment contend that one of the government employees provided the name to reporters. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman also told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, apparently in response to a request from Libby for details about a former ambassador's trip to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq tried to buy uranium yellowcake in that African nation. She learned that Plame was a CIA employee from yet another government official and advised Libby. The identity of the other government official remains a secret.
