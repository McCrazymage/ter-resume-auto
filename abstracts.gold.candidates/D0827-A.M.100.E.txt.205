``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters. The source expressed solidarity with the US government and people at the tragic circumstances and offered condolences to the families of the victims. Qatar ``is following up with profound sorrow'' the tragic results of the Katrina Hurricane, the source added.
