Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
