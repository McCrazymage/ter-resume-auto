Nevertheless, this new generation of anti-evolutionists, arguing that children have a ``right to question'' scientific truths, has had widespread success in undermining evolutionary theory. According to a recent Gallup poll, about a third of Americans believe that the Bible is literally true. Some of these believers have persuaded politicians, school boards and parents across the country to question their children's textbooks. Also last week, a Georgia county school board voted to appeal a judge's decision to remove stickers describing evolution as a ``theory, not a fact'' from school textbooks.
