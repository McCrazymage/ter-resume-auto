The police refused to discuss whether these men might be connected to the hate groups that have been a prime focus of the investigation. The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two white men they want to question in connection with this week's execution-style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband, in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives, friends and sympathizers of a white-supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the judge's assassination.
