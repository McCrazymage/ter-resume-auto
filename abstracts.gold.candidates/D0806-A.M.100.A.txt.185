The agreement, which involves emergency weekend sessions of both the House and Senate, marks the first time Congress has intervened directly in an individual right-to-die case. Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing about.'' ``Please, please, please save my little girl,'' said Mary Schindler. With the clock running down on how much longer Terri Schiavo can remain alive, congressional leaders Saturday announced an unprecedented agreement that would allow Schiavo's parents to petition the federal courts to have a feeding tube replaced for their brain-damaged daughter.
