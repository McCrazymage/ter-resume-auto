The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands-free devices. Researchers estimated the time of the crash and looked at whether the driver used a cell phone in the minutes leading up to the accident. The study, which is to appear in The British Medical Journal on Tuesday, is the first of its kind to use actual crash data and cell phone records to show a link between talking on the phone and being seriously injured in an accident.
