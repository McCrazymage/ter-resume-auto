Last week, in Pennsylvania's Dover School District, an administrator read a statement to ninth-grade biology students saying that evolution is not fact. Rather than attempt to prove that the world was created in six days, they operate simply by casting doubt on evolution, largely using the time-honored argument that intelligent life could not have come about by a random natural process and must have been the work of a single creator. Also last week, a Georgia county school board voted to appeal a judge's decision to remove stickers describing evolution as a ``theory, not a fact'' from school textbooks.
