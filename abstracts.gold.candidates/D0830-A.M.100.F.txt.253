``The bottom line : BTK is arrested,'' said Wichita police chief Norman Williams, describing the investigation as ``the most intense and challenging'' of his department's entire history. Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
