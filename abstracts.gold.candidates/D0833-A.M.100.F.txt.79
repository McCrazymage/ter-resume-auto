India plans to put a 525 kg orbiter using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket 100 km over the moon to explore the earth's satellite. ISRO officials said a three-dimensional atlas of regions of scientific interest of the moon will be mapped with instruments on board the mission, besides exploring the lunar surface for elements such as magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron and titanium. ISRO had allotted 10 kgs and 10 watts of power for space agencies of other nations and had invited international bids for the purpose that had evoked 15 responses from 10 nations.
