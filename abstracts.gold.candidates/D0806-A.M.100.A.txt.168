The agreement, which involves emergency weekend sessions of both the House and Senate, marks the first time Congress has intervened directly in an individual right-to-die case. Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life. Outside the nursing facility in Florida where Schiavo is being cared for, her mother had pleaded earlier Saturday for lawmakers and the president to intervene. Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing about.''
