Some 800,000 people were gathering Thursday in a vast field on the edge of the southern Polish city of Krakow for a mass in memory of Pope John Paul II, a police spokeswoman said. ``He left something very special for me, as a sign of his gratitude, but I'm not prepared to say what it is,'' he said, adding that Dziwisz had given it to him on his arrival in Rome on Sunday. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
