Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters. The Qatar News Agency quoted a source at the Foreign Ministry as saying that the donation was made in the name of the government and people of Qatar. The source expressed solidarity with the US government and people at the tragic circumstances and offered condolences to the families of the victims. Qatar ``is following up with profound sorrow'' the tragic results of the Katrina Hurricane, the source added.
