``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars. Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters. Qatar ``is following up with profound sorrow'' the tragic results of the Katrina Hurricane, the source added.
