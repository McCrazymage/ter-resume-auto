Because most breast cancer starts in a milk duct, scientists had theorized that flushing those ducts with fluid might draw out cancerous cells even before they could be spotted on a mammogram. They don't work as well on the more dense breast tissue of women under 50, so scientists are testing alternatives like MRI scans to screen younger women at high risk of cancer because a close relative had it. Doctors put an anesthetic on the nipple and inserted a threadlike catheter to flush milk ducts with fluid that dislodges and draws out cells.
