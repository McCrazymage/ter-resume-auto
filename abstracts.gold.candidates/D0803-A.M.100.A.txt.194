Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time.
