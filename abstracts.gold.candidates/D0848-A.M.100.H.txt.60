Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday. The charges stem from his remarks in an interview with a Swiss newspaper in which he said ``30,000 Kurds and 1 million Armenians were killed in Turkey'' during World War I and in the 1980s and 1990s.
