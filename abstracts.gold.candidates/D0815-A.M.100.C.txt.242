Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. Nelson said that the details of his plan remain fluid, but that it would leave the filibuster rules intact while confirming more of Bush's nominees than Reid has said his party can accept. Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise. But both men rejected elements of Nelson's plan Tuesday and signaled that they want a showdown vote on the filibuster issue -- often called ``the nuclear option'' -- as early as next week, if not Friday.
