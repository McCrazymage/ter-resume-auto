At the center of the scandal is Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and longtime friend and political associate of some of his party's most gifted strategists, including Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition and the Southern regional chairman for President Bush's re-election campaign, and noted conservative activist Grover Norquist. He is also among the elite group of ``Pioneers'' who pledged to raise more than $ 100,000 for Bush's re-election campaign this year.
