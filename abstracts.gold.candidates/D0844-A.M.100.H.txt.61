President Bush Friday rejected conservative calls to withdraw his nomination of White House counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and prepared to reassure skeptical Republicans and persuade the Senate to confirm her for the seat of retiring Justice Sandra Day O 'Connor. Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.'' Among the most outspoken detractors was former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who, on NBC television's ``Meet the Press'' program, said Bush should name someone else to fill the vacancy on the US high court.
