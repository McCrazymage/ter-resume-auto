French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the ``total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380.'' The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. In a statement released by his office soon after the airliner landed, Chirac said ``a new page of aeronautical history has been written.It is a magnificent result for European industrial cooperation and an encouragement to pursue this path of building a Europe of innovation and progress.''
