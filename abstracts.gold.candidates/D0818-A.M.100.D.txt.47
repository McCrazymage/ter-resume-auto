The police refused to discuss whether these men might be connected to the hate groups that have been a prime focus of the investigation. The authorities would not say where or when the two men, one in his mid-20s and the other aged 50 to 60, were seen or whether they were suspects or witnesses. In addition, Hal Turner, a white-supremacist radio host in New Jersey who said in 2003 that it would be illegal but not wrong to kill Lefkow said Wednesday that federal agents had also questioned him about his whereabouts during the Monday killings.
