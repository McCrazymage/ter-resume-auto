In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
