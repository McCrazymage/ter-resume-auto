``I think we are going to see photographs of one or more suspects being posted within days,'' the official told the paper. According to The Times, a single bomb maker using military-grade explosives was most likely responsible for manufacturing all the bombs used in the attacks. Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source. ``The nature of the explosives appears to be military, which is very worrying,'' Superintendent Christophe Chaboud, head of France's anti-terrorism police, who is helping the London inquiry, was quoted as saying.
