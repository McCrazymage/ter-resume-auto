Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. In a letter to the New York Times following Taylor's resignation, the warlord said the Indian preacher's intervention had been a decisive factor in his decision.
