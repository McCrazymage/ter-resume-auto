Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising the case said Wednesday. His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich. ``They are examining blood and other samples. They are still considering the theory of poisoning, but also finding difficulty in proving it,'' he said, declining to name the US hospital as he had not asked their permission.
