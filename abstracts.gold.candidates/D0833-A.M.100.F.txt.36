ISRO officials said a three-dimensional atlas of regions of scientific interest of the moon will be mapped with instruments on board the mission, besides exploring the lunar surface for elements such as magnesium, aluminium, silicon, calcium, iron and titanium. The satellite-based networks that will be established later this year with the help of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) will offer connectivity to major hospitals in India to improve healthcare in the war-ravaged country.
