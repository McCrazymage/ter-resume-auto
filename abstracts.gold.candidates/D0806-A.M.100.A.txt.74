The agreement, which involves emergency weekend sessions of both the House and Senate, marks the first time Congress has intervened directly in an individual right-to-die case. Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing about.'' Terri Schiavo's case has become a cause celebre for evangelical Christians, who have opposed efforts by her husband to end the medical measures that have kept her alive for the past 15 years.
