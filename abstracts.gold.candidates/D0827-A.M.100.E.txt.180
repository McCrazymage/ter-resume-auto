``The industry loss for Hurricane Katrina could be between 35 and 50 billion dollars,'' Brit's chief executive Dane Douetil told reporters after the company posted a 61-percent rise in interim pre-tax profits. Katrina will have ``a profound impact on (insurance) market conditions'', Douetil added. Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars. The Qatar News Agency quoted a source at the Foreign Ministry as saying that the donation was made in the name of the government and people of Qatar.
