The White House announced Saturday night that President Bush would fly to Washington from his Texas ranch Sunday to sign the emergency legislation. Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life. ``Please, please, please save my little girl,'' said Mary Schindler. Terri Schiavo's case has become a cause celebre for evangelical Christians, who have opposed efforts by her husband to end the medical measures that have kept her alive for the past 15 years.
