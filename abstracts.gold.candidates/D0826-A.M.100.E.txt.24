At the center of the scandal is Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and longtime friend and political associate of some of his party's most gifted strategists, including Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition and the Southern regional chairman for President Bush's re-election campaign, and noted conservative activist Grover Norquist. To their credit, it is two independent-minded Republicans -- McCain and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado -- who have exposed the sordid tale and are trying to clean up the mess.
