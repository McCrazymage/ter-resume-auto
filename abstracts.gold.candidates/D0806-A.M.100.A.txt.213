Press secretary Scott McClellan said the president was standing with ``all those'' working to save Schiavo's life. Outside the nursing facility in Florida where Schiavo is being cared for, her mother had pleaded earlier Saturday for lawmakers and the president to intervene. A vigil was kept at the facility in Pinellas Park; three people were arrested when they tried to enter the hospice. Schiavo's husband, Michael, who has fought to have her feeding tube removed, said Congress was ``getting into something they know nothing about.''
