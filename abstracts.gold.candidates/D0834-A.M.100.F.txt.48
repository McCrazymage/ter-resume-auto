The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post : With their slick Web sites, pseudo-academic conferences and savvy public relations, the proponents of ``intelligent design'' -- a ``theory'' that challenges the validity of Darwinian evolution -- are far more sophisticated than the creationists of yore. They do no experiments and do not publish in recognized scientific journals. In states as diverse as Wisconsin, South Carolina, Kansas, Montana, Arkansas and Mississippi, school boards are arguing over whether to include ``intelligent design'' in their curriculums.
