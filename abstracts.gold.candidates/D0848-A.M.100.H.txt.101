The 53-year-old author, wearing a dark business suit and tie, made his way into the cramped courtroom amid a crowd of reporters, supporters and protestors.

Rehn said Turkey should make serious efforts in bringing its legislation in line with EU laws, including the European Convention of Human Rights.
