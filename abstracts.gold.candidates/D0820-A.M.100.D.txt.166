The ships include one submarine tender and three minesweepers, Marine Self Defense Force spokesman Hidetsubu Iwamasa said. Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity. Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help. In televised comments, Pacific Fleet spokesman Capt. Alexander Kosolapov said there was contact with the sailors, who were not hurt, and that authorities were preparing to send down a similar vessel to assess the situation.
