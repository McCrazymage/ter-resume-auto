Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy held a crisis meeting Friday on running riots that have plunged France into its worst explosion of urban violence in decades. As the violence has progressed, it has taken on an increasingly dangerous tone, with widespread fire-bombings, occasional shots fired at riot squads -- and prosecutors revealing that a handicapped woman was deliberately set on fire. According to prosecutors Friday, a 56-year-old woman was unable to get off a bus targeted by a Molotov cocktail late Wednesday in the northern Paris suburb of Sevran.
