As the first hot days of Texas summer count down to the scorching temperatures of late July and August, ERCOT managers say the grid is prepared. It's ready to meet the demands of 20 million Texans; ready to deal with another peak day like that of Aug. 7, 2003, when the state's electrical usage reached a record 60,095 megawatts. Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast.
