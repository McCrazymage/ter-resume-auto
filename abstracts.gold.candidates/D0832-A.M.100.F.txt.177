The contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for $ 1,675,000. Cunningham, meanwhile, upgraded to a $2.55 million house, with 7 1/2 baths and a five-car garage. Cunningham said in a statement that he didn't do anything wrong. He said the sale price was based on ``comparables from an independent source'' -- but it turns out that source was a real estate agent whose family also has contributed heavily to Cunningham; Wade simply paid the asking price.
