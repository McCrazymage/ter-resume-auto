The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a bus on Thursday morning. Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station. ``The nature of the explosives appears to be military, which is very worrying,'' Superintendent Christophe Chaboud, head of France's anti-terrorism police, who is helping the London inquiry, was quoted as saying.
