Republican Dino Rossi held a mere 261-vote lead over Democratic Attorney General Christine Gregoire after all counties reported their final tallies to the state. ``After this election, I'm going to have' Every vote counts' tattooed on my forehead,'' Gregoire spokesman Morton Brilliant said Wednesday. ``We really aren't going to know before we do this recount who the governor is going to be,'' said Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who will oversee the recount process.
