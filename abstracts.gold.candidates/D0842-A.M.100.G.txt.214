Inhabitants of Akhaltsikhe blocked a dozen trucks carrying pipes belonging the oil company British Petroleum (BP). BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned.
