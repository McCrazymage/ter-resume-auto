Gunmen stormed into the city's Chaldean and Armenian churches in the latest attacks on Iraq's minority Christian community, they said. ``We were then taken outside and the armed men set off the devices. We heard three blasts,'' he told AFP outside the church which was set ablaze. The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the 1950s and enlarged four decades later. Iraq's Christian parties complain they lack funding and are living in danger ahead of landmark parliamentary elections scheduled for January 30.
