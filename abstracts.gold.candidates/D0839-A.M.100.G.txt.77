Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media. Obasanjo invited Taylor to Nigeria in order to bring an end to a 14-year-civil war which pitched the guerrilla chief turned elected ruler against two powerful rebel groups.
