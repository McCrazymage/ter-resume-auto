French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the ``total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380.'' The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour.
