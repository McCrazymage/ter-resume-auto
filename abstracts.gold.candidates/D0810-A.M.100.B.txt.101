Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations. The board members concluded their unscheduled meeting early Thursday evening without deciding whether to keep or remove Raines after the announcement by the SEC's top accountant that the company had violated two rules. Three board members, joined by Raines and other regulators, had attended a briefing at the commission by its chief accountant on Wednesday shortly before he announced his decision, people at the meeting said.
