The latest installment in the Harry Potter series won't hit stores for more than six months but it has already topped at least one bookseller's most wanted list and is racking up thousands of advance orders, retailers said Wednesday. ``There is so much demand people want to make sure they get their copy,'' Marino said. She said when the last Potter book went on sale, Waterstones' central London store started selling it just after midnight and had sold 2,000 copies within two hours.
