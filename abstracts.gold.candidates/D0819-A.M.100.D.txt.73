Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy held a crisis meeting Friday on running riots that have plunged France into its worst explosion of urban violence in decades. Overwhelmed police have found themselves powerless to stop the conflagration, which has seen over 1,000 vehicles torched and more than 200 people arrested amid fears that the country's racial and social divisions were fuelling the violence, the worst seen since a 1968 student revolt. Overnight Thursday, more than 600 vehicles and several businesses were set on fire, and 78 people arrested in the Paris area, according to police.
