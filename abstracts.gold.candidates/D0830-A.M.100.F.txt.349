Among the information he gave at that time was an admission that he had killed another woman in the 1980s. Police said Saturday that they were investigating the man's involvement in nine killings, including that April 1985 murder and one more killing in January 1991. A DNA test of sperm left at one of the murder victims' homes was analyzed in the 1980s but did not yield a match. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
