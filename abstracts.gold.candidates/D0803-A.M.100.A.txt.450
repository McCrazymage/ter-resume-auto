In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production. The accident happened at Taiping Coal Mine of Qingxu County, when 25 persons were working underground.
