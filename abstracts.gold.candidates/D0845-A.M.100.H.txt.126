The ivory-billed woodpecker is one of six North American bird species thought to have gone extinct since 1880. Experts have rediscovered the Ivory billed woodpecker in the United States 61 years after it was put on the extinct list and the government said Thursday that 10 million dollars would be spent to make sure it stays alive. ``This is one of those pivotal moments in conservation,'' he said Thursday at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
