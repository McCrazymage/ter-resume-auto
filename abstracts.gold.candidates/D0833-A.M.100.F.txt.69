India plans to put a 525 kg orbiter using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket 100 km over the moon to explore the earth's satellite. ``The best suited proposals have been short listed. We have to find out whether they finally fit into our mission payload,'' the sources said. The satellite-based networks that will be established later this year with the help of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) will offer connectivity to major hospitals in India to improve healthcare in the war-ravaged country.
