With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour. Its comparative lack of noise was the result of demands by customers that Airbus make the plane even more quiet than it already was, a process that took six months.
