Just Friday, columnist Charles Krauthammer and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol called on Bush to withdraw the Miers nomination, with Krauthammer deriding her selection as ``scandalous'' and ``a joke.'' Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.'' The president made it clear Friday that he has no intention of backing down. Conservative outrage over President George W. Bush's controversial pick of Texas lawyer Harriet Miers to fill a vacancy on the US Supreme Court was unabated Sunday as activists called on the White House to withdraw her nomination.
