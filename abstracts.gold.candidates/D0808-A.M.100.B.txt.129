``We were then taken outside and the armed men set off the devices. We heard three blasts,'' he told AFP outside the church which was set ablaze. ``Gunmen entered the church at about 4 : 30 pm (1330 GMT). They gathered those present in one room and planted explosive charges in different parts of the building,'' said Father Raghid Aziz Kara at the Chaldean church. In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
