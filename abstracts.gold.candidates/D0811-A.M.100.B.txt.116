The planet is a typical member of the Kuiper belt, but its sheer size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be classified as a planet, Brown said. But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of ``planet'' and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. A US astronomer announced Friday he had discovered what could be a 10th planet in the outer reaches of the solar system nearly 15 billion kilometers (nine billion miles) from earth.
