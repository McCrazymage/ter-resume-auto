Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. Police have arrested the alleged serial killer suspected of at least seven brutal slayings in Kansas starting in the 1970s, Kansas authorities announced Saturday. Authorities released a photograph of a smiling Rader on Saturday. Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston said during Saturday's news conference that the investigation was still ongoing.
