Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the former head of the KGB -- the Soviet agency which used drugs against political foes and foreign spies. ``They are examining blood and other samples. They are still considering the theory of poisoning, but also finding difficulty in proving it,'' he said, declining to name the US hospital as he had not asked their permission. Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no idea as to what caused them.
