A recount is required by state law when there is less than a 2,000-vote margin. The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast. ``We really aren't going to know before we do this recount who the governor is going to be,'' said Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who will oversee the recount process.
