British police are on the verge of identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday. Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source. ``The nature of the explosives appears to be military, which is very worrying,'' Superintendent Christophe Chaboud, head of France's anti-terrorism police, who is helping the London inquiry, was quoted as saying.
