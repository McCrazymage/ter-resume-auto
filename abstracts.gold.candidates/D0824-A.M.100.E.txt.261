They don't work as well on the more dense breast tissue of women under 50, so scientists are testing alternatives like MRI scans to screen younger women at high risk of cancer because a close relative had it. To test it, doctors at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital administered ductal lavage to 39 women just before their breasts were removed for known cancer. Doctors put an anesthetic on the nipple and inserted a threadlike catheter to flush milk ducts with fluid that dislodges and draws out cells. The milk duct technique, called ductal lavage, is among those experimental alternatives.
