The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. It will also give gay couples the right to adopt. ``It would impose on society a virus, something false, which will have negative consequences for social life,'' insisted Juan Antonio Martinez Camino, spokesman for Spain's Episcopal Conference. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual.
