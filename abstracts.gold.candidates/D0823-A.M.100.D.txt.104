Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the former head of the KGB -- the Soviet agency which used drugs against political foes and foreign spies. Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no idea as to what caused them. Zimpfer said the hospital had found no evidence of poisoning and neither had a medical insitute in the United States to which they referred the case within days.
