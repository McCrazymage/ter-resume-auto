The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour. In a statement released by his office soon after the airliner landed, Chirac said ``a new page of aeronautical history has been written.It is a magnificent result for European industrial cooperation and an encouragement to pursue this path of building a Europe of innovation and progress.''
