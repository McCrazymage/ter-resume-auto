The ships include one submarine tender and three minesweepers, Marine Self Defense Force spokesman Hidetsubu Iwamasa said. The submarine tender, which is equipped with rescue gear, left from Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo and is expected to rendezvous with the other ships at the site off Russia's Pacific coast on Monday or Tuesday, he said. Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help.
