Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. Giant pandas in western China could be at risk of starvation because the bamboo plants that they eat are beginning to die off in a cycle that happens about every 60 years, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of the 220,000-hectare (544,000-acre) preserve, Xinhua said.
