The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement. Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday. The star of ``Speed'' and ``While You Were Sleeping'' also gave one million dollars after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.
