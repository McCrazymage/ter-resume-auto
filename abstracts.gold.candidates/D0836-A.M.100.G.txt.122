Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying-off stage. However, the cycle seems to run along different schedules in different places and an earlier mass die-off of bamboo in the 1980s caused the deaths of about 250 pandas, Xinhua said. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
