A study of Australian drivers found that those using cell phones were four times as likely to be involved in a serious crash regardless of whether they used hands-free devices like earpieces or speaker phones that have been perceived as making talking while driving safer. It is also the first to definitively conclude outside of a laboratory setting that holding a phone to your ear and talking through a hands-free device poses the same risks. The new study examined the cell phone records of 744 drivers who had accidents in Perth, Australia, where drivers are required to use hands-free devices.
