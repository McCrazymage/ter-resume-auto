The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. Spain ``is in the forefront of Europe and of the world in the struggle against centuries of discrimination,'' de la Vega said. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual. Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt.
