``I continue to be touched by the outpouring of support I have received from so many of you,'' she wrote. In a posting on her Web site, marthatalks.com, Stewart instead urged fans to make a donation to the American Cancer Society instead. Ana Marengo, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society in New York, said Stewart and her company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, have long had a team that participates in an annual walk in Central Park -- ``Making Strides'' -- to raise money for breast cancer research. Stewart participated with her team in last year's walk, Marengo said.
