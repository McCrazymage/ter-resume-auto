The bus explosion was one of four co-ordinated bombings, the others on London Underground subway trains, which caused carnage in the morning rush hour. Some experts have speculated that the bus bomb might have gone off accidentally as the terrorist carried it, possibly to another Underground station. According to The Times, a single bomb maker using military-grade explosives was most likely responsible for manufacturing all the bombs used in the attacks. Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source.
