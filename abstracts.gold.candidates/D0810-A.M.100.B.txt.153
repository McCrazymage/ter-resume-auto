Fannie Mae's board also met on Thursday to be briefed on the SEC's order that it restate earnings and declare losses of as much as $9 billion as a result of the accounting violations. That decision will now force the company to restate its earnings and take steps to significantly raise its capital level. Fannie Mae, which for years has been one of the most formidable political forces in Washington, maintained a low public profile. The company declined to comment further about the findings of the SEC staff or the remarks of lawmakers.
