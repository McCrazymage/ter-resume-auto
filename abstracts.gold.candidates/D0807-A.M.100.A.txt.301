Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting ``that such information was not widely known,'' the indictment said. The person referred to as ``then White House press secretary'' is Ari Fleischer. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman also told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, apparently in response to a request from Libby for details about a former ambassador's trip to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq tried to buy uranium yellowcake in that African nation. The identity of the other government official remains a secret.
