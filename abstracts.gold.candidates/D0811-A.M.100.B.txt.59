The body is ``the 10th planet of the solar system,'' said Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy in a phone conference from CalTech in the town of Pasadena. The planet is a typical member of the Kuiper belt, but its sheer size in relation to the nine known planets means that it can only be classified as a planet, Brown said. While observing the new, so-called planet from Hawaii last month, a team of astronomers led by Michael Brown of the California Institute of Technology spotted a faint object trailing next to it.
