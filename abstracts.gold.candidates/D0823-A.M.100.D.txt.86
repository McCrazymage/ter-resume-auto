West-leaning Yushchenko, who Wednesday called for a fresh vote as official results showed Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich had defeated him in Sunday's presidential election, was admitted to the private Austrian hospital in September suffering from a severe gastro-intestinal illness. Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the former head of the KGB -- the Soviet agency which used drugs against political foes and foreign spies. His camp immediately said it was the result of a poisoning attempt by political rivals at a time when he had a strong lead over Yanukovich.
