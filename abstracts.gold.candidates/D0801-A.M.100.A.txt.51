With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric-ton giant aloft at about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport here. Its comparative lack of noise was the result of demands by customers that Airbus make the plane even more quiet than it already was, a process that took six months.
