In addition, Hal Turner, a white-supremacist radio host in New Jersey who said in 2003 that it would be illegal but not wrong to kill Lefkow said Wednesday that federal agents had also questioned him about his whereabouts during the Monday killings. According to a report in Wednesday's issue of The Chicago Sun-Times, the authorities are also pursuing telephone calls made to Lefkow's home Sunday night from a correctional facility. ``I fear that to be true, and that's the great tragedy of it,'' Lefkow said, according to an article posted Wednesday evening on The Sun-Times Web site.
