Those in the control room are employees of a quasi-governmental entity called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas. Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast. Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the state because the system isn't connected to other major grids in North America.
