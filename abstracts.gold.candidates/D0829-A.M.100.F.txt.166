The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement. Actress Sandra Bullock has given one million dollars to the American Red Cross to boost its tsunami relief campaign, the organisation said Monday. ``Bullock contacted the Red Cross last week to make this, her second million dollar gift, to the American Red Cross,'' added the statement. Stars of sound and cinema in Canada are getting in on the fundraising act to help victims of the tsunami, it is reported here Thursday.
