``If nothing hits him again, or nothing else has appeared in the meanwhile, I guess he has a fair and great likelihood of making a full recovery,'' Dr Michael Zimpfer, the president of Vienna's Rudolfinerhaus Hospital where Yushchenko was treated, told AFP. Zimpfer said Yushchenko, whose skin has been discoloured and pockmarked by the illness, was also likely to regain the good looks for which he is noted. Zimpfer said he regularly spoke to Yushchenko's family and his doctors in Ukraine and therefore knew his symptoms but still had no idea as to what caused them.
