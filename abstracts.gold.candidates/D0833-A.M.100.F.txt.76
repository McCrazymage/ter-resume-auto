India plans to put a 525 kg orbiter using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket 100 km over the moon to explore the earth's satellite. India's mission is aimed at expanding the scientific knowledge about the moon, upgrading India's technological capability and providing challenging opportunities for planetary research to the younger generation. After the recent visits of Afghan President Hamid Karzai to Delhi and Indian foreign minister K. Natwar Singh to Kabul last month, the Afghan health ministry decided to upgrade IGICH with a polyclinic, a diagnostic center and a surgical block, IGICH director Abdul Salam Jalali told media.
