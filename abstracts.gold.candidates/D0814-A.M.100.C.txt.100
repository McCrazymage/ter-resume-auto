Blair told reporters that the African monitoring forces must be expanded by sending thousands of troops to ensure ceasefire agreement and access of true information on the situation in Darfur. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said. He, meanwhile, stressed the importance of reaching a comprehensive peace in southern Sudan by the end of this year, saying the peace in the south will be a key for solving the Darfur crisis because it will provide a national government which is honest and balanced.
