At the center of the scandal is Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and longtime friend and political associate of some of his party's most gifted strategists, including Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition and the Southern regional chairman for President Bush's re-election campaign, and noted conservative activist Grover Norquist. Abramoff is a leading GOP fund-raiser, having collected hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years for House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and other top Republicans.
