``We estimate there are almost 800,000 faithful at the moment, but people continue to fill up the Blonia esplanadae,'' said police spokeswoman Sylwia Bober. Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to ``be himself.'' Magee was private secretary to John Paul II from his election in 1978 until 1982 when he was succeeded by Polish Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, who was at the pontiff's bedside when he died last Saturday. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
