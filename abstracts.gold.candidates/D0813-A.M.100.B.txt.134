The recount means Washington voters will have to wait until next Wednesday to find out who their next governor is _ a stunning scenario considering the experts never thought it would be this close. Washington is one of two states (the other is Alaska) that allow voters to mail ballots on Election Day, so votes have trickled in at an agonizingly slow pace. ``We really aren't going to know before we do this recount who the governor is going to be,'' said Secretary of State Sam Reed, a Republican who will oversee the recount process.
