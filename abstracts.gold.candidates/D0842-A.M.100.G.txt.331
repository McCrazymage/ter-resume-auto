BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
