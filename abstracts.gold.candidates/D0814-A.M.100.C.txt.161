Blair made the call at a press conference held at the end of his several-hour visit to Sudan. Khartoum must take serious steps to implement the United Nations resolutions on Darfur and specify the areas for its army and the militias in the region, said Blair. The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he said. The prime minister denied that any of the European countries has desire to send troops to Darfur, stressing the capability of the African forces to control the situation in Darfur.
