The Sudanese government has agreed to withdraw its military forces to their barracks and to send police forces to take their places, he said. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said. He, meanwhile, stressed the importance of reaching a comprehensive peace in southern Sudan by the end of this year, saying the peace in the south will be a key for solving the Darfur crisis because it will provide a national government which is honest and balanced.
