``It ends the speculation,'' said Leonard Garment, who served as acting White House counsel during the investigation into the Watergate break-in, and published a book called ``In Search of Deep Throat'' in 2000.

Fielding, who according to media reports had denied that he was Deep Throat, could not be reached for comment.
