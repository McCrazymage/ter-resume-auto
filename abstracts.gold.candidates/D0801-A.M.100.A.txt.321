With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric-ton giant aloft at about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport here. The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes, but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
