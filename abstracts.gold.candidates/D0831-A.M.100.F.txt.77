Despite mistrust on both sides, Restrepo said the government is willing to release the 15 jailed rebels first, provided the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, at least expresses a willingness to reciprocate. ``All we 're looking for is a minimum sign of hope and we will start the ball rolling,'' Restrepo told local radio. The previous administration of President Andres Pastrana held face-to-face peace talks with the FARC for three years inside a safe haven as large as Switzerland in the jungles and cattle country of southern Colombia.
