Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
