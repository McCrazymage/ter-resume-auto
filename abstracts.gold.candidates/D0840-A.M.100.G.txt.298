The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast. Studies of the outages indicated problems in Canada cascaded into the Northeast, leaving New York and Detroit without power for days. Texas, residents were told, is protected from power outages outside the state because the system isn't connected to other major grids in North America.
