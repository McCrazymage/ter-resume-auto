The plan ``recognises all rights for homosexuals, when it comes to qualifying for a pension, administering an estate, asking for a loan, authorising surgery for a partner,'' cabinet spokeswoman Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega told reporters. But according to an opinion poll conducted in late July, some two-thirds of Spaniards are in favour of gay marriages and now the cabinet has approved the bill such liaisons could become legal from as early as next year. The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans.
