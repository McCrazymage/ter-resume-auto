This weekend they are getting some help from an unlikely source : Nickelodeon, the No. 1 network for children, is replacing its usual Saturday afternoon lineup with a message encouraging young viewers to go outside and play. They also make money when they package their characters with food products, such as Kraft's SpongeBob SquarePants macaroni-and-cheese, featuring the Nickelodeon character. After all, their revenue models depend on children watching plenty of television, which includes commercials for junk food.
