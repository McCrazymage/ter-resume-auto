Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this. ``The trial of a novelist who expressed a non-violent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU,'' EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement.
