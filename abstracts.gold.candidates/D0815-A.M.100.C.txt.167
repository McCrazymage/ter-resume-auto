Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Both parties' leaderships are wary of a bipartisan bid by a few centrists to find a middle ground that would force GOP and Democratic leaders to accept options they have called intolerable. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' Reid and Frist said they remain open to a possible compromise.
