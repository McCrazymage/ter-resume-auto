But when rescue workers airlifted the owner last week, Molly, a black Labrador seeing-eye dog, was left behind. Five days passed, said Laura Maloney, director of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before the New Orleans police, National Guard soldiers and a man named Joe with a boat found their way to the house. But Maloney say endings as happy as this have been frustratingly rare so far. Maloney said the center received at least 700 animals on Monday alone.
