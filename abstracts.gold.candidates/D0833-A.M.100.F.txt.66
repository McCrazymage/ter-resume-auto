India plans to put a 525 kg orbiter using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket 100 km over the moon to explore the earth's satellite. ``The best suited proposals have been short listed. We have to find out whether they finally fit into our mission payload,'' the sources said. India's mission is aimed at expanding the scientific knowledge about the moon, upgrading India's technological capability and providing challenging opportunities for planetary research to the younger generation.
