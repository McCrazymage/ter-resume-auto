Zhao Tiechui, director of the National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration, revealed on Monday that so far, 12,148 coal mines have been ordered to suspend production for rectification. In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production. The accident happened at Taiping Coal Mine of Qingxu County, when 25 persons were working underground.
