After nearly four hours, the Airbus landed at company headquarters outside the city of Toulouse in southern France. In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour. ``The takeoff went perfectly,'' Alain Garcia, an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in Paris. Its comparative lack of noise was the result of demands by customers that Airbus make the plane even more quiet than it already was, a process that took six months.
