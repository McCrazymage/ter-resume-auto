Abramoff is a leading GOP fund-raiser, having collected hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years for House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and other top Republicans. ``All told, six tribes paid more than $66 million to Mr. Scanlon, and Mr. Abramoff received more than $21 million from Mr. Scanlon for his share of the scheme,'' Campbell said.
