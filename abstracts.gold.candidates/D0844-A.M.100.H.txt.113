Just Friday, columnist Charles Krauthammer and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol called on Bush to withdraw the Miers nomination, with Krauthammer deriding her selection as ``scandalous'' and ``a joke.'' Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.'' The president made it clear Friday that he has no intention of backing down. Among the most outspoken detractors was former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who, on NBC television's ``Meet the Press'' program, said Bush should name someone else to fill the vacancy on the US high court.
