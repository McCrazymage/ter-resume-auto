Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. Threatened pandas will be moved to areas that still have bamboo, with special attention given to older, feeble animals, it said, citing Zhang Kerong, the preserve's director. Pandas derive most of their nutrition from arrow bamboo and can starve once the plant enters its dying-off stage. Zhang said rangers would patrol for ailing animals and rescue those in need.
