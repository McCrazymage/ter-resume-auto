Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the government and the presidency. Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev insisted that voting in crucial parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic on Sunday was being conducted fairly, but a leading opposition figure cried foul.
