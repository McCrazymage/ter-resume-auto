``After this election, I'm going to have' Every vote counts' tattooed on my forehead,'' Gregoire spokesman Morton Brilliant said Wednesday. The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast. The election is reminiscent of the 2000 U.S. Senate race in Washington that took several weeks of counting and recounting before Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner over Republican incumbent Slade Gorton.
