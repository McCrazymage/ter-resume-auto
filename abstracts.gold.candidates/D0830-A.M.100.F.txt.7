Authorities said they had arrested 59-year-old Dennis Rader, a citizen of Park City, Kansas, on Friday, after police pulled the man over in his vehicle during a ``routine'' stop. The balding man, wearing eyeglasses and sporting a moustache, was said to have lived on the same street as one of the victims.
