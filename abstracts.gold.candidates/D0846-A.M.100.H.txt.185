Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to ``be himself.'' ``I think it would be very wrong if a new pope would try to emulate what John Paul II had,'' he said. Magee was private secretary to John Paul II from his election in 1978 until 1982 when he was succeeded by Polish Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, who was at the pontiff's bedside when he died last Saturday. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
