The townspeople complain that convoys of trucks carrying material for the project have wrecked roads in the area and are demanding compensation, the Imedi television station said. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline. In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
