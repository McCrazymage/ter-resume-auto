The rediscovery ``is thrilling beyond words'', John W. Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, told reporters. The bird was spotted near where it was last seen. The black-and- white bird, with a nearly one-meter wingspan and its distinctive ivory-colored bill, is larger than the more common pileated woodpecker that is similar in appearance. Twenty years ago, Chris Pague picked up a stuffed specimen of an ivory-billed woodpecker and marveled at what had been lost.
