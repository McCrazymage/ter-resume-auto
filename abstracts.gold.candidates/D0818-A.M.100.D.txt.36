The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two white men they want to question in connection with this week's execution-style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband, in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives, friends and sympathizers of a white-supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the judge's assassination. ``They know where I was and I 've been cleared,'' David Hale said Wednesday.
