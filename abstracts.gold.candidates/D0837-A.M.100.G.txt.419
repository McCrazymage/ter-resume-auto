Earlier this year, Starlet Travis voted Republican in the U.S. Senate race here. After Travis watched Barack Obama speak at a fundraiser here a few days ago, she rushed to meet him. ``You 're the only person in this race that we trust,'' she told Obama, as she gave him a photograph to sign. On one side is a Harvard-educated attorney and long-time Illinois resident who practiced civil rights law. While no one says the race is close, it is nevertheless one of the highly watched political contests this season.
