The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a bus on Thursday morning. ``I think we are going to see photographs of one or more suspects being posted within days,'' the official told the paper. Similar components have been found by police at all four bomb sites, the newspaper said without citing a source.
