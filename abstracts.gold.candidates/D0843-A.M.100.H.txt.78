Amazon could not say exactly how many pre-orders it had gotten, but the company said its Web site had been deluged after it began taking orders for the novel late Tuesday. Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item. She said when the last Potter book went on sale, Waterstones' central London store started selling it just after midnight and had sold 2,000 copies within two hours.
