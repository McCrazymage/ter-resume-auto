In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. Coal is the major energy resource in China, covering 67 percent of the country's consumption structure of all primary energy resources. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. Official statistics said that from January to September this year, 4,228 people were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. Up to Oct. 10, there were 43 major accidents nationwide.
