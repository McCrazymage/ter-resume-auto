Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike on Thursday demanded that senior executives, including the chief executive, Franklin D. Raines, return tens of millions of dollars in bonuses and other compensation that they had earned based on inaccurate financial statements that the company issued from 2001 until this year.

Three board members, joined by Raines and other regulators, had attended a briefing at the commission by its chief accountant on Wednesday shortly before he announced his decision, people at the meeting said.
