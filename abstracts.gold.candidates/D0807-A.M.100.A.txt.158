Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman also told Libby that Plame worked at the CIA, apparently in response to a request from Libby for details about a former ambassador's trip to Niger to investigate claims that Iraq tried to buy uranium yellowcake in that African nation. Names of two of the others were disclosed by a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the identities have not been publicly released. The identity of the other government official remains a secret.
