Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L 'Equipe's story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's National Research Institute. Ayotte though was quick not to cast doubts on the testing procedures of the French laboratory cited in the L 'Equipe report. Ayotte suggested this hadn't been the case with the findings used by L 'Equipe to back up their story. Alessandro Donati, a specialist in the fight against doping in sport, suggested the performances of the 33-year-old American appear to show he has used a range of banned substances, including anabolic steroids.
