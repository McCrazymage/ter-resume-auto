The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. As the first hot days of Texas summer count down to the scorching temperatures of late July and August, ERCOT managers say the grid is prepared. Studies of the outages indicated problems in Canada cascaded into the Northeast, leaving New York and Detroit without power for days.
