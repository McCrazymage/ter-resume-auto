The townspeople complain that convoys of trucks carrying material for the project have wrecked roads in the area and are demanding compensation, the Imedi television station said. Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned.
