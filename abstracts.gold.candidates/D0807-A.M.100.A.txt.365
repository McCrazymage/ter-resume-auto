In no case other than Libby's does the indictment contend that one of the government employees provided the name to reporters. Libby discussed Plame's employment at the CIA with Fleischer, noting ``that such information was not widely known,'' the indictment said. She learned that Plame was a CIA employee from yet another government official and advised Libby. Names of two of the others were disclosed by a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the identities have not been publicly released. The identity of the other government official remains a secret.
