The workers also gaze at something more familiar : two monitors displaying The Weather Channel. Those in the control room are employees of a quasi-governmental entity called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas. The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast.
