Medicare has a toll-free hotline and a Web site to help people sort through the new Part D drug coverage. 1) Have your Medicare card and a list of all your medications handy. 3) After listing some pertinent dates, you will be asked to select either ``enrollment'' ``information'' or ``publication.'' 5) Tell the agent you want a list of stand-alone drug plans and their costs to you, based on your particular medications.
