Paul told journalists after meeting Taylor : ``He said' there will be tremendous destabilisation in Liberia if the extradition takes place '.'' ``There is no question in my mind that there will be chaos,'' added Paul. The evangelist said he had spoken to ``nine of Taylor's top 10 generals'' and that he feared that Taylor could have sufficient support in Liberia so that his extradition and prosecution for warcrimes could provoke violent unrest. However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his guru Paul.
