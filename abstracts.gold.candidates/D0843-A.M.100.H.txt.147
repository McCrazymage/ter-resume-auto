Amazon said it took 420,000 pre-orders for the fifth in the series, ``Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' released in the summer of 2003, making it the largest ever pre-order item. The company was expecting a similar response for the latest installment. ``There is so much demand people want to make sure they get their copy,'' Marino said. She said when the last Potter book went on sale, Waterstones' central London store started selling it just after midnight and had sold 2,000 copies within two hours.
