In recent years, the Chinese government has issued a series of regulations and measures to improve coal mine safety. The move comes in the wake of a series of coal mine and coal mine-related accidents across the country which claimed dozens of lives between Nov. 3 and 8. Official statistics said that from January to September this year, 4,228 people were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. A major accident means more than 10 deaths at one time. The small township coal mine, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons, has all valid documents for production.
