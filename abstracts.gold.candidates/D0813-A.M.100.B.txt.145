The closest governor's race in Washington history was forced into a recount as counties finished tallying the ballots and found only a few votes separating the candidates out of 2.8 million cast. Washington is one of two states (the other is Alaska) that allow voters to mail ballots on Election Day, so votes have trickled in at an agonizingly slow pace. ``It's fun, it's exciting, it's like a two-week playoff series. But it's a lot more important than a ballgame,'' said Joe Arko, a Texas doctor who has been following the Washington election religiously on the Internet.
