Inhabitants of Akhaltsikhe blocked a dozen trucks carrying pipes belonging the oil company British Petroleum (BP). Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. In August five Georgian police officers were injured during a protest by environmentalists opposed to the construction of the pipeline, which is due to come into service next year. The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
