Two churches in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul came under simultaneous attack on Tuesday, witnesses and clerics said, but there were no immediate reports of casualties. At the same moment, gunmen attacked an Armenian church, forcing out a security guard and two other people inside the building, the guard said, adding : ``I heard two explosions.'' The Chaldean church, one of the largest in Mosul, was built in the 1950s and enlarged four decades later. In a coordinated assault on August 1, six car bombs killed 10 people and injured 50 others outside churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
