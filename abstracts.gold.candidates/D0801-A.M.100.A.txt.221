With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. In the morning, the crowds cheered as the huge double-deck plane rotated skyward at its takeoff speed of about 170 miles per hour. ``The takeoff went perfectly,'' Alain Garcia, an Airbus engineering executive, told the LCI television station in Paris. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes, but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
