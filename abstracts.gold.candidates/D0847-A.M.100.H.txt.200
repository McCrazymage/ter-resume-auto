Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. Kyrgyzstan's President Askar Akayev insisted that voting in crucial parliamentary elections in the former Soviet republic on Sunday was being conducted fairly, but a leading opposition figure cried foul. Opposition supporters in Kyrgyzstan have held protests for more than a week since a March 13 run-off election that saw the opposition presence in the 75-member parliament reduced to a mere handful of seats.
