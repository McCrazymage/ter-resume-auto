The police refused to discuss whether these men might be connected to the hate groups that have been a prime focus of the investigation. The authorities would not say where or when the two men, one in his mid-20s and the other aged 50 to 60, were seen or whether they were suspects or witnesses. ``They know where I was and I 've been cleared,'' David Hale said Wednesday. ``I fear that to be true, and that's the great tragedy of it,'' Lefkow said, according to an article posted Wednesday evening on The Sun-Times Web site.
