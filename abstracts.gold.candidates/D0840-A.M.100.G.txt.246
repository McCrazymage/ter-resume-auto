Those in the control room are employees of a quasi-governmental entity called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas. The agency operates and maintains Texas' electric grid, which serves 85 percent of all of the state's electricity users and covers 75 percent of the state's sprawling geographic area. As the first hot days of Texas summer count down to the scorching temperatures of late July and August, ERCOT managers say the grid is prepared.
