North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. Similar remarks were made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il last month during a meeting with a South Korean envoy. North Korea on Monday proposed resuming six-nation talks on its nuclear program during the week of September 12, a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the North's official KCNA news agency as saying. Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13-day session in Beijing.
