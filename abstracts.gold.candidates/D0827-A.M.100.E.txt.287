Several European insurance giants have meanwhile predicted a ceiling of 30 billion dollars. The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani decided on Saturday to contribute 100 million US dollars to the victims of the Katrina hurricane in the United States. Up until now the highest estimate has been 35 billion dollars, forecast by Risk Management Solutions -- a US group specialised in evaluating the financial cost of disasters. The source expressed solidarity with the US government and people at the tragic circumstances and offered condolences to the families of the victims.
