North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. The offer came last week in Laos during a meeting of Asian foreign ministers, according to Radio Pyongyang, monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Paek was quoted as saying North Korea would rejoin the treaty and open up to international inspectors ``once the nuclear issue is resolved smoothly.'' That they lasted so long is encouraging : Three previous rounds ended after only three days.
