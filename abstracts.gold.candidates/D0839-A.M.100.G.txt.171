Liberia's exiled former leader Charles Taylor expressed concern Wednesday that his country may fall back into chaos if he is extradited from Nigeria to face war crimes charges, his spiritual adviser said. ``There is no question in my mind that there will be chaos,'' added Paul. However, he exchanged greetings with an AFP reporter and other journalists who had been invited to his luxury Calabar villa by his guru Paul. Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media.
