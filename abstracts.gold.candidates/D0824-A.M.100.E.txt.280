Mammograms work very well at detecting early breast cancer, but they 're not perfect. To test it, doctors at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital administered ductal lavage to 39 women just before their breasts were removed for known cancer. ``Ductal lavage should not be recommended to high-risk women as a technique to detect cancer earlier than imaging modalities'' she concluded. The test uncovered clear cancer signs in just 13 percent of the cancerous breasts tested, and possible signs in 42 percent.
