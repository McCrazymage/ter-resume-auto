Dawn Zobel, a public information officer at Alderson, said she could neither confirm nor deny that Stewart has been the recipient of such a tsunami of mail. Ana Marengo, a spokesman for the American Cancer Society in New York, said Stewart and her company Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, have long had a team that participates in an annual walk in Central Park -- ``Making Strides'' -- to raise money for breast cancer research. Stewart participated with her team in last year's walk, Marengo said.
