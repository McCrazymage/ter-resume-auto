In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin, Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The workers also gaze at something more familiar : two monitors displaying The Weather Channel. Those in the control room are employees of a quasi-governmental entity called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. ERCOT's job is to make sure the power doesn't go out in Texas.
