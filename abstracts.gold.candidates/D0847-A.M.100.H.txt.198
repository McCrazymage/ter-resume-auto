Among those detained was the meeting's organizer, Bolot Maripov, who had unsuccessfully run against Akayev's daughter, Bermet Akayeva. Maritov is also the founder of a respected daily in the Kyrgyz capital, Obshchestvennoye Mneniye. The demonstrators had intended to march onto the seat of the government and the presidency. Voting equipment being used such as indelible ink for marking voters' fingers to ensure they vote only once and transparent ballot boxes ``are all recognised as ensuring fair and honest elections,'' the Kyrgyz leader said after casting his vote in the capital Bishkek.
