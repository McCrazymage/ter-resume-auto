Inhabitants of Akhaltsikhe blocked a dozen trucks carrying pipes belonging the oil company British Petroleum (BP). BP heads plans to build a pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea through the Georgian capital Tbilisi to Ceyhan in Turkey on the Mediterranean. The pipeline is to carry a million barrels of oil a day from the Caspian to Turkey. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
