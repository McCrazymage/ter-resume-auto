The prime minister called on the Sudanese government to commit to the humanitarian protocol it reached with the Darfur rebels in Nigerian capital of Abuja in September and to help humanitarian aid reach affected people of Darfur. The international community will provide financial and logistic support for the African forces in Darfur, he said. He, meanwhile, stressed the importance of reaching a comprehensive peace in southern Sudan by the end of this year, saying the peace in the south will be a key for solving the Darfur crisis because it will provide a national government which is honest and balanced.
