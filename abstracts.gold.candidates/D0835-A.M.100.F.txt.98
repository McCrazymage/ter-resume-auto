From my perspective, these critics are jumping to unfair conclusions. The prevailing view was that top offensive performances in baseball demanded quick reflexes, good eye-hand coordination, quick feet, flexibility and strong wrists -- not bulky muscles. Indeed, it was probably around 10 years ago that some people in baseball became aware that anabolic steroids were being used by some players.
