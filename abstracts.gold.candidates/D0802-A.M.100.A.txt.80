Leaders of the Arctic region's indigenous people on Friday urged European countries to step up the fight against global warming, saying it is threatening their societies, economies and cultures. There are fears that polar bears and some seal species could face extinction in just decades because of global warming. The council believes temperatures in the Arctic will increase 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2080.
