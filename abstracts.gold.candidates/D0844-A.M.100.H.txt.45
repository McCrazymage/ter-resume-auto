Bush advisers who once anticipated all-out war with Democrats over his attempts to reshape the Supreme Court have had to recalibrate their strategy to battle an insurrection among Republicans who contend the president was obligated to nominate a top-flight legal figure with an unmistakably conservative pedigree. Just Friday, columnist Charles Krauthammer and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol called on Bush to withdraw the Miers nomination, with Krauthammer deriding her selection as ``scandalous'' and ``a joke.'' Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.''
