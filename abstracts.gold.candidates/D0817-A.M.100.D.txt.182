L 'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined ``Armstrong's Lie'' suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999. But she believes the paper's use of this as evidence is unethical. Ayotte suggested this hadn't been the case with the findings used by L 'Equipe to back up their story. In such a case she argued you had to have the possibility of carrying out a second B Sample test to verify the result.
