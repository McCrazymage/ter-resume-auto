In a hushed, dimly lit room in Austin, Texas, and in an identical space in nearby Taylor, people responsible for keeping the lights on in Texas intently scrutinize computer monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Those in the control room are employees of a quasi-governmental entity called ERCOT, the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. Most Texans knew little of the grid until August 2003, when the nation's largest power outage caused blackouts in the Northeast.
