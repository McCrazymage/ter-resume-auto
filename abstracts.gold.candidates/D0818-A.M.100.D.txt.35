The police released composite sketches Wednesday night of two white men they want to question in connection with this week's execution-style slayings of a federal judge's mother and husband, in an investigation that has also included interviews with relatives, friends and sympathizers of a white-supremacist imprisoned for soliciting the judge's assassination. David Hale' told the authorities that he came home from his maintenance job at 1:30 p.m. Monday, took a nap, ate dinner and watched a movie with his children, then went to a local convenience store that has a security camera.
