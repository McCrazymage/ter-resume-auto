The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has short-listed experiments from five nations including the United States, Britain and Germany, for a slot on India's unmanned moon mission Chandrayaan-1 to be undertaken by 2006-2007, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday. India's mission is aimed at expanding the scientific knowledge about the moon, upgrading India's technological capability and providing challenging opportunities for planetary research to the younger generation. ISRO had allotted 10 kgs and 10 watts of power for space agencies of other nations and had invited international bids for the purpose that had evoked 15 responses from 10 nations.
