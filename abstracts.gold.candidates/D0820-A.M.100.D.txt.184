Russia asked for the assistance Friday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said separately on condition of anonymity. Navy spokesman Capt. Igor Dygalo said the U.S. Navy has also been asked for assistance, the RIA-Novosti news agency reported. Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help. At Moscow's request, Japan has dispatched four naval vessels to help rescue a Russian submarine snagged on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, but the ships aren't expected to arrive at the scene until early next week.
