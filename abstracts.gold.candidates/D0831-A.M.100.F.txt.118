After any initial prisoner exchange, the meeting, which could last up to five days, would take place in the Vatican's embassy in Bogota or at another diplomatic mission in the capital, according to the government proposal, which was first announced Thursday night and then amplified Friday. Before any face-to-face meeting can take place, however, the rebels must agree to swap 15 hostages for 15 rebels jailed on minor charges, said Peace Commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo. Augusto Castro, vice president of the Catholic Church's ruling body in Colombia, said he hopes the FARC reacts positively to the offer.
