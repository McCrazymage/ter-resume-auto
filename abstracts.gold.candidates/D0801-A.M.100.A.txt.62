With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. The plane is Europe's newest competitor in the battle with the Boeing Co. In a statement released by his office soon after the airliner landed, Chirac said ``a new page of aeronautical history has been written.It is a magnificent result for European industrial cooperation and an encouragement to pursue this path of building a Europe of innovation and progress.''
