Lawmakers from the European parliament and leading Turkish intellectuals were present for the trial in which Pamuk, 53, risks six months to three years in jail. The 53-year-old author, wearing a dark business suit and tie, made his way into the cramped courtroom amid a crowd of reporters, supporters and protestors. He also claimed that almost no one dares to speak out about this. ``The trial of a novelist who expressed a non-violent opinion casts a shadow over the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU,'' EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said in a statement.
