The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt. Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who took office in April, has made legalising gay marriages a key element of his social policy despite outrage from the Church.
