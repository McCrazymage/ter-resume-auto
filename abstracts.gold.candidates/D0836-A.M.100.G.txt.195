Workers at the Baishuijiang State Nature Preserve in the northwestern province of Gansu plan to monitor the 102 pandas in the preserve for signs of hunger, Xinhua said in a report late Sunday. The stage begins when the bamboo forms flowers, after which the pandas refuse to eat it. Blooming happens about once every 60 years, with a new crop taking 10 years to mature. Flowering bamboo now covers more than 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) of the 220,000-hectare (544,000-acre) preserve, Xinhua said.
