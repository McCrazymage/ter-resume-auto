Villagers in nearby Tkemlana also demonstrated against the building of the pipeline, local officials told AFP. They pointed out that their homes are in an area with a high earthquake risk and call for the pipeline to be banned. They are further demanding a promised payment of 110,000 lari (57,291 dollars, 46,187 euros) for the land needed for the pipeline. They also claim that 80 percent of their houses have been half destroyed by the continual passage of the heavy trucks.
