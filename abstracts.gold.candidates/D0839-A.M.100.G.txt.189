Paul told journalists after meeting Taylor : ``He said' there will be tremendous destabilisation in Liberia if the extradition takes place '.'' ``There is no question in my mind that there will be chaos,'' added Paul. Under the terms of the asylum deal which brought Taylor to Nigeria in August 2003, the former president is forbidden from giving interviews to the media. Obasanjo invited Taylor to Nigeria in order to bring an end to a 14-year-civil war which pitched the guerrilla chief turned elected ruler against two powerful rebel groups.
