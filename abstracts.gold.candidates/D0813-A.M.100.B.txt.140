The recount means Washington voters will have to wait until next Wednesday to find out who their next governor is _ a stunning scenario considering the experts never thought it would be this close. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has ``never seen anything like this before.'' The election is reminiscent of the 2000 U.S. Senate race in Washington that took several weeks of counting and recounting before Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner over Republican incumbent Slade Gorton.
