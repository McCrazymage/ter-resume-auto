Just Friday, columnist Charles Krauthammer and Weekly Standard editor William Kristol called on Bush to withdraw the Miers nomination, with Krauthammer deriding her selection as ``scandalous'' and ``a joke.'' Another icon of the conservative movement, former Judge Robert H. Bork, denounced it as ``a disaster on every level.'' Asked about the calls to withdraw the nomination, he said, ``No, she is going to be on the bench, she 'll be confirmed. And when she's on the bench, people will see a fantastic woman who is honest, open, humble and capable of being a great Supreme Court judge.''
