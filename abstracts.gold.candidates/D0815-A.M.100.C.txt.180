Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., has said the ability to filibuster judicial nominees, now or in the future, must end. Neither man could claim victory under compromises being promoted by Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., among others. Nelson said senators would have to pledge to use filibusters only in ``extreme or extraordinary cases.'' Frist, noting that four of the controversial nominations could be called to the Senate floor any time, told reporters that ``the suggestion has been made, let's go straight through the executive calendar and deal with them one by one. And I think it's time to do that.''
