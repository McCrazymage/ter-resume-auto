The next pope should not try to be another John Paul II, the Polish-born pope's first private secretary, Irish Bishop John Magee, said Thursday. ``He left something very special for me, as a sign of his gratitude, but I'm not prepared to say what it is,'' he said, adding that Dziwisz had given it to him on his arrival in Rome on Sunday. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
