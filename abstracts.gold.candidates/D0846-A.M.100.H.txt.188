Magee told journalists that the next pope should try to ``be himself.'' ``I think it would be very wrong if a new pope would try to emulate what John Paul II had,'' he said. ``He left something very special for me, as a sign of his gratitude, but I'm not prepared to say what it is,'' he said, adding that Dziwisz had given it to him on his arrival in Rome on Sunday. According to his final testament released Thursday by the Vatican, the pope left no personal property, instructing Dziwisz to burn all his personal notes.
