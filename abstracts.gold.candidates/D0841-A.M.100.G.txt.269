The Spanish government on Friday approved a bill to legalise homosexual marriages, which will make it only the third country in Europe to condone same sex marriages. It will also give gay couples the right to adopt. The idea has been fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church and a senior cleric earlier this week blasted the plans. She said that about four million of Spain's 40 million inhabitants were homosexual. Once the reform becomes law Spain will join the Netherlands and Belgium in allowing full homosexual marriage, though only the Netherlands allows gay couples to adopt.
