If confirmed, the discovery by Professor Mike Brown of the respected California Institute of Technology would be the first of a planet since Pluto was identified in 1930. But Brown conceded that the discovery would likely rekindle debate over the definition of ``planet'' and whether Pluto should still be regarded as one. A US astronomer announced Friday he had discovered what could be a 10th planet in the outer reaches of the solar system nearly 15 billion kilometers (nine billion miles) from earth.
