With a whisper more than a roar, the largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380, took off on its maiden flight Wednesday. The airliner's four engines lifted the 421 metric-ton giant aloft at about 10:29 a.m. as hundreds watched at the Blagnac airport here. French President Jacques Chirac immediately hailed the ``total success of the first test flight of the Airbus A380.'' The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers in three classes, but it can be expanded to 800 seats.
