Evelyn Hutcheson and David Hale, the mother and brother of Matthew Hale, the man convicted last year of plotting the murder of the judge, Joan Humphrey Lefkow, said Wednesday that federal agents had asked them whether Hale might have communicated something from prison in code. In addition, Hal Turner, a white-supremacist radio host in New Jersey who said in 2003 that it would be illegal but not wrong to kill Lefkow said Wednesday that federal agents had also questioned him about his whereabouts during the Monday killings.
