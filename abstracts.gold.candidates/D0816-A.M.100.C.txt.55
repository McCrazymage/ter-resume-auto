North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. Paek was quoted as saying North Korea would rejoin the treaty and open up to international inspectors ``once the nuclear issue is resolved smoothly.'' North Korea on Monday proposed resuming six-nation talks on its nuclear program during the week of September 12, a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the North's official KCNA news agency as saying.
