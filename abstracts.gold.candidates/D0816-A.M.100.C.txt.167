North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-Sun has said the Stalinist country would return to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty if a standoff over its nuclear weapons drive were resolved, state media said Sunday. The offer came last week in Laos during a meeting of Asian foreign ministers, according to Radio Pyongyang, monitored by South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Similar remarks were made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il last month during a meeting with a South Korean envoy. Six-party talks about North Korea's nuclear arsenal have recessed after a 13-day session in Beijing.
