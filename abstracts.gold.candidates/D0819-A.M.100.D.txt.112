As the violence has progressed, it has taken on an increasingly dangerous tone, with widespread fire-bombings, occasional shots fired at riot squads -- and prosecutors revealing that a handicapped woman was deliberately set on fire. Rescued by the driver, she was taken to hospital with severe burns to 20 percent of her body. Overnight Thursday, more than 600 vehicles and several businesses were set on fire, and 78 people arrested in the Paris area, according to police.
