Because most breast cancer starts in a milk duct, scientists had theorized that flushing those ducts with fluid might draw out cancerous cells even before they could be spotted on a mammogram. They don't work as well on the more dense breast tissue of women under 50, so scientists are testing alternatives like MRI scans to screen younger women at high risk of cancer because a close relative had it. To test it, doctors at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital administered ductal lavage to 39 women just before their breasts were removed for known cancer.
