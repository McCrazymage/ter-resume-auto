( c) 2004, Newsday= NEW YORK -- Martha Stewart says she has been deluged by ``thousands'' of letters from fans sent to her federal prison camp in Alderson, W.V., some of which have even included gifts and money. ``Instead, if you are so inclined, please make a donation to the American Cancer Society, a charitable organization that means a lot to me,'' she wrote. Stewart participated with her team in last year's walk, Marengo said.
