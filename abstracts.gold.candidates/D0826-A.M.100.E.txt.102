The unfolding scandal touches some of the GOP's most influential elected officials and lobbyists, and could rock the capital before it's over. At the center of the scandal is Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and longtime friend and political associate of some of his party's most gifted strategists, including Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition and the Southern regional chairman for President Bush's re-election campaign, and noted conservative activist Grover Norquist. Abramoff was called before a hearing of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee last week, where he spent the morning invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
