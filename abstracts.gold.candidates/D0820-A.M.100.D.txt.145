The Russian submarine had been tending an underwater antenna mounted to the sea floor when it became snagged on a wire helping to stabilize a ventilation cable attached to the antenna, the official said. Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help. All seven crew members were alive and rushed aboard a Russian surface vessel, where they were being examined by a medical team, Russian news agencies and the U.S. Navy said.
