L 'Equipe on Tuesday carried a front page story headlined ``Armstrong's Lie'' suggesting the Texan had used the illegal blood booster EPO (erythropoeitin) during his first Tour win in 1999. Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L 'Equipe's story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's National Research Institute. Alessandro Donati, a specialist in the fight against doping in sport, suggested the performances of the 33-year-old American appear to show he has used a range of banned substances, including anabolic steroids.
