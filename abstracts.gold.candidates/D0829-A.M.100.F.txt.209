The funds from the Hollywood actress will be used to provide relief supplies, financial support and technical assistance, the American Red Cross said in a statement. ``Bullock contacted the Red Cross last week to make this, her second million dollar gift, to the American Red Cross,'' added the statement. Plans are in the works for several big concerts, with the proceeds going to various charities involved in the tsunami relief effort. Canadian record label Nettwerk Management has enlisted some of its big guns to perform in benefit concerts at the end of the month.
