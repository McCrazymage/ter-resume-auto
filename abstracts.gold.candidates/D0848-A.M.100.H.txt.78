The 53-year-old author, wearing a dark business suit and tie, made his way into the cramped courtroom amid a crowd of reporters, supporters and protestors. The court, in a ruling dated December 2, said that since the alleged offence was committed before Turkey amended its penal code earlier this year, Pamuk should be judged under the old law, which requires a direct order from the justice ministry for the trial to proceed. Justice Minister Cemil Cicek in remarks published Friday said he had not received the prosecution file by Thursday afternoon, making it unlikely the trial would begin Friday.
