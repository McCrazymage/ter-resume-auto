Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising the case said Wednesday. ``They are examining blood and other samples. They are still considering the theory of poisoning, but also finding difficulty in proving it,'' he said, declining to name the US hospital as he had not asked their permission. Zimpfer said the hospital had found no evidence of poisoning and neither had a medical insitute in the United States to which they referred the case within days.
