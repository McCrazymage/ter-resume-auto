Russian navy officials said the mini-submarine, trapped at a depth of 190 meters (625 feet), had seven sailors aboard, and it was unclear how long their oxygen supply would last. Interfax said Russia's Pacific Fleet commander was in talks with top U.S. Navy officers over how the United States might help. At Moscow's request, Japan has dispatched four naval vessels to help rescue a Russian submarine snagged on the floor of the Pacific Ocean, but the ships aren't expected to arrive at the scene until early next week.
