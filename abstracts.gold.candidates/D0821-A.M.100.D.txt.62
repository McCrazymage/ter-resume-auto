The Financial Times, which cited an unnamed European official involved in international efforts to find the bombers, said progress had been made towards naming who was responsible for a blast on a bus on Thursday morning. British police are on the verge of identifying one person they believe was involved in the bomb attacks which killed at least 52 people in London, a report said Tuesday. Separately, The Times newspaper reported that forensic pathologists are paying particularly close attention to two bodies found inside the wrecked bus to see whether one of them might have been the bomber.
