A recount is required by state law when there is less than a 2,000-vote margin. Washington is one of two states (the other is Alaska) that allow voters to mail ballots on Election Day, so votes have trickled in at an agonizingly slow pace. Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat who is stepping down after two terms, said he has ``never seen anything like this before.'' The election is reminiscent of the 2000 U.S. Senate race in Washington that took several weeks of counting and recounting before Democrat Maria Cantwell was declared the winner over Republican incumbent Slade Gorton.
