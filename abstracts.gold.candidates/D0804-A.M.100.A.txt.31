Five days passed, said Laura Maloney, director of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, before the New Orleans police, National Guard soldiers and a man named Joe with a boat found their way to the house. Out of at least 3,000 cats and dogs and several hundred birds, reptiles and other exotic pets recovered so far, only 300 to 400 have been reunited with their owners since the storm, she said.
