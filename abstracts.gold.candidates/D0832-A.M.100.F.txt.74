The contractor, Mitchell Wade of MZM Inc., bought the house for $ 1,675,000. MZM, one of Cunningham's top campaign donors, obtained millions in government contracts; the congressman, who also sits on the House intelligence committee, acknowledged to Stern that he had helped MZM win contracts, as he said he has helped other firms. He said the sale price was based on ``comparables from an independent source'' -- but it turns out that source was a real estate agent whose family also has contributed heavily to Cunningham; Wade simply paid the asking price.
