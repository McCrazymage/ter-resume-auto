The sports daily based its accusation on tests carried out by a French laboratory on frozen urine samples taken during the race six years ago. Armstrong issued an immediate denial and on Wednesday L 'Equipe's story came under fire from Christiane Ayotte, a director at Canada's National Research Institute. ``The stablity of EPO in urine isn't as long as five years according to our testing here in Montreal. It's more a matter of months,'' stressed Ayotte, whose testing centre is accredited to WADA, the world's anti-doping agency.
