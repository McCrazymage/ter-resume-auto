Ukraine's opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko has a good chance of making a full recovery from an illness that has prompted charges of poisoning and ravaged his appearance, a Viennese doctor supervising the case said Wednesday. ``There was no underlying illness of the liver or pancreas that suddenly broke out,'' he said. Press reports noted that Yushchenko fell ill after a meeting with the former head of the KGB -- the Soviet agency which used drugs against political foes and foreign spies.
